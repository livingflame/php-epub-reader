# php-epub-reader

This project does not require a database so you can just clone or download this repository and then move to your webhost of choice.

- Move all your epub files under books/ directory.
- Visit the main page. If you don't see your books or not all books have been listed properly, go to cache/ directory and remove books.json

Please let me know if there are bugs, thank you!
