  <h3>Chapter 505: Air Force</h3>

  <p>It can be said that the relations between the two empires were getting so tense that they were already on the verge of war. Moreover, the Radiant Church was involved in this situation. So with how special the location of Golden Island was, it was common sense for Zhao Hai to not leave for the prairie and instead stay on Golden Island to defend it.</p>

  <p>But Zhao Hai didn’t think so. After analyzing the situation with Green and Randolph, they came to the conclusion that the two empires wouldn’t be able to declare war with each other very easily.</p>

  <p>Therefore, Zhao Hai used this opportunity to go to the Prairie and take a look at the situation there. It was now the beginning of spring in the Prairie and the grass had started to grow. The beastmen would return to herding and communicating with each other. This was the best time for Zhao Hai to go to the Prairie.</p>

  <p>Additionally, Zhao Hai was also planning about how he would spend his time with his wives. He was now an 8th rank expert, so he would have no issues with spending the night with all of them. However, the women didn’t think the same, they were afraid that Zhao Hai would hurt his body. Therefore, they told him that he can only accompany one of them each night.</p>

  <p>Zhao Hai was now thinking about how hard it must be to be his wife. He equally loved his wives, but when he spends the night with one of them, he would think about how lonely it would be for the others. This made him feel sadness in his heart.[1]</p>

  <p>But it was great that the women weren’t showing any signs of envy to one another. This made Zhao Hai happiness instead of guilt.</p>

  <p>Although Zhao Hai had been used to living as a person of the Ark Continent, he was still a person from Earth deep inside. Because of this, he still felt distant to how people acted in the continent.</p>

  <p>….</p>

  <p>Even if the Rosen and Aksu Empires were in a tense situation and were having small conflicts here and there, they were still afraid to fully attack each other. However, the Rosen Empire was still leading the stand-off due to how they were hampering the Aksu Empire’s economy. This made the Aksu Empire feel tense.</p>

  <p>This time, when Zhao Hai travels to the Prairie, he wasn’t planning on riding a carriage nor sailing on a boat. He was preparing to sit on the back of a Blood Hawk as it flew towards the Prairie.</p>

  <p>As the Space was upgraded a few times, the Blood Hawks’ strength had gotten stronger and stronger as well. Because of this, Zhao Hai wanted to try to ride one. This was also to make the existence of his Blood Hawk known to the continent.</p>

  <p>Zhao Hai planned to bring Laura and the others along, naturally, Shue and Shun were coming as well. On the other hand, he didn’t bring Blockhead and Rockhead. He had them stay on Golden Island and manage some matters there. Zhao Hai didn’t want the two of them to be his bodyguards forever. He wanted them to be more like Green when they grow up.</p>

  <p>The two didn’t disagree, they also understood what Zhao Hai wanted so they went to study under Kun. After all, they still had the Space, they can see Zhao Hai at any time.</p>

  <p>While Zhao Hai and the others were sitting on the backs of Blood Hawks, the Rosen Empire was in a stir. After all, there weren’t any humans before that could fly on the backs of flying Magic Beasts. This was the reason why Air Forces were nonexistent among human nations. But now, one appeared so it was impossible for people to not pay attention. Even the Monarchs personally asked questions.</p>

  <p>Having an Air Force meant that one would have a new avenue in attacking the enemy. It can also do reconnaissance missions. Because of that, people were constantly on the look for any possibilities of acquiring one.</p>

  <p>The first person to look for Zhao Hai was Randolph. Randolph didn’t think that Zhao Hai would have such Magic Beasts. The moment he found out about this, he immediately approached Kun and had him talk to Zhao Hai. Randolph wishes for Zhao Hai to give a unit to the Calci Family.</p>

  <p>Kun felt that this matter wasn’t easy to deal with, so he immediately contacted Zhao Hai. Zhao Hai sent over a message to Randolph that basically meant that Zhao Hai was waiting for someone to give word.</p>

  <p>After hearing the message, Randolph understood. He was a Patriarch, and he had seen a lot. Because of this he immediately knew what Zhao Hai was talking about, that someone who Zhao Hai was waiting for was naturally the Rosen Emperor.</p>

  <p>One must know that nations had always dreamt of having their own Air Force, but they still hadn’t succeeded in making one. And now that Zhao Hai had one of his own, this matter had naturally became quite a huge matter in the empire. If Zhao Hai wanted to give some units away, the first one to receive them should be the Emperor. If he didn’t, the Emperor would definitely be offended.</p>

  <p>After Randolph thought through this point, he didn’t disturb Zhao Hai any longer and was now waiting for the Emperor. Before long, the Emperor called for Randolph since Zhao Hai was in the Prairie.</p>

  <p>When Randolph received the summons, he immediately knew what was going to happen. He didn’t dally and swiftly went to the imperial palace to have an audience with the Emperor inside his study.</p>

  <p>After having sat down, the Emperor looked at Randolph and smiled, “Randolph, your granddaughter’s husband is truly extraordinary. He really does have tons of good things.”</p>

  <p>Randolph forced a smile and said, “Your Majesty overpraised. Who knows what that boy has? To tell you the truth, I had no idea that he had an Air Force. I came to find him this time, only to find out that he had ran over to the Prairie. I already approached his clan to send him a message to come back.”</p>

  <p>The Emperor nodded and said, “Good” Then he carefully asked, “What kind of Magic Beast does this Air Force use?”</p>

  <p>Randolph smiled faintly and said, “Your Majesty, he isn’t using Magic Beasts, but instead, Phantasmal Beasts.”</p>

  <p>The Emperor stared, then his expression changed, “Phantasmal Beast? That’s impossible. With how Phantasmal Beasts were, you should know that they aren’t capable of carrying people. We have already researched having Phantasmal Beasts as an Air Force before, but didn’t it fail?”</p>

  <p>Randolph forced a smile and said, “Your Majesty, of course I know. But what they were using were indeed Phantasmal Beasts, I saw them with my own eyes. They rode those beasts as they flew into the sky and when they went back down, they transformed into armor.”</p>

  <p>The Emperor found himself unable to sit still, he stood up and asked, “What? Is that true?”</p>

  <p>Randolph smiled and said, “Your Majesty, I wouldn’t dare lie to you about this. I asked housekeeper Kun about this matter and he said that those Phantasmal Beasts are things that Little Hai personally raised. The physical properties of those Phantasmal Beasts aren’t very different from Magic Beasts. Moreover, not only can they turn into armor and carry a person on their backs, they also don’t need to absorb energy from humans. Feeding them meat was enough to sustain them.”</p>

  <p>The Emperor stared, then he said, “So there was such things. Those Phantasmal Beasts may be good for us. A few thousand of them would certainly benefit us greatly.”</p>

  <p>Randolph forced a smile as he replied, “Your Majesty, you shouldn’t overestimate them. After all, a Phantasmal Beast is still a Phantasmal Beast, they cannot carry people that are too heavy. Moreover, they also cannot be equipped with a lot of things. At most, Knights can carry two quivers of arrows as well as a bow and a short sword.”</p>

  <p>The Emperor smiled faintly and said, “That’s already quite good. Right, go discuss this with Zhao Hai. Do you think that he would be able to give me several thousands to play with?”</p>

  <p>When Randolph heard the Emperor, his smile got more bitter. His Majesty was a good ruler, but there were times where he would act just like a spoiled child who wants to have all his whims accomplished. Randolph can only smile and said, “Your Majesty, you also know that training Phantasmal Beasts isn’t very easy. I’m afraid that Little Hai wouldn’t have a large number of them.”</p>

  <p>The Emperor snorted and said, “What’s to be afraid about, if he can’t train them, the empire will lend him a hand. With the strength of our Rosen Empire, it would be impossible for us to be unable to train Phantasmal Beasts. In any case, tell him to give me Phantasmal Beast eggs, the more the better.”</p>

  <p>Randolph forced a smile and said, “Yes, Your Majesty. Rest assured, I will immediately talk to him when he comes back. Right, Your Majesty, I also heard that in their armor form, those Phantasmal Beasts could still use their wings. When someone wears the armor, they would be able to fly at a low altitude for a short distance.”</p>

  <p>Then Randolph stopped since he could feel that with each word that he said, the Emperor’s heartbeat would get louder and louder. One could see clearly how exhilarated the Emperor was just by thinking about the beasts. But nobody can blame him, generations of rulers have always dreamed of having their own Air Force. Randolph was afraid that the Emperor would ask for more Phantasmal Beasts from Zhao Hai if he spoke more words.</p>

  <p>Just like what Randolph thought, the Emperor immediately said, “Fantastic! That’s great! Go, go, quickly send a letter to Zhao Hai. Tell him that he has five days to send me the Phantasmal Beasts.”</p>

  <p>Randolph bitterly smiled and then gave a bow before asking to be excused. He still didn’t know whether Zhao Hai can provide the beasts in five days. Can Zhao Hai get back from the Prairie at that time?</p>

  <p>After he returned home, Randolph immediately wrote a letter for Zhao Hai. The letter was sent through Kun who immediately told Zhao Hai about this matter. Zhao Hai naturally didn’t oppose, he also sent a reply that he would send the beasts in five day’s time.</p>

  <p>Actually, this buzz about his Air Force was deliberately set up by Zhao Hai. He knew that his Air Force wouldn’t be hidden for long. Additionally, if he didn’t reveal this matter, the Rosen Empire would feel dread when he revealed it in the future. Because of this, Zhao Hai decided to just let this matter out. As long as he provide the Rosen Empire with a few Phantasmal Beasts, the Emperor wouldn’t feel to bad about him.</p>

  <p>Five days later, Randolph brought 300 Phantasmal Beasts and 1000 eggs to the Imperial Palace and handed them over to the Emperor. At the same time, Randolph also handed instructions about how to handle them; what to do when they hatch, how to take care of them after birth, how to raise them up and how to train them. Every detail was carefully written.</p>

  <p>These things were naturally the work of Ni’er. Ni’er liked raising animals the most. Although the Phantasmal Beasts can be hatched by the Space, Ni’er was still curious and had gotten herself a few eggs to study. She found the way to hatch them normally, as well as how to raise them properly. At the same time, she also recorded the weights that the Blood Hawk can manage, the distance of flight in accordance to the load, and many other statistics.</p>

  <p>Zhao Hai also asked Ni’er before he went and made copies of them. He didn’t change anything and just had every single one of Ni’er’s findings written down.</p>

  <p>After the Emperor received the beasts and the notes, he immediately had a trusted aide raise the Blood Hawks according to the notes provided. At the same time, he also had the already grown up Blood Hawks train with Knights.</p>
