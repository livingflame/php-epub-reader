<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON DRUMMED HIS</span></span> heels against the side of the boulder he was sitting on, bored and impatient to be gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He, Saphira, and Arya—as well as Blödhgarm and the other elves—were lounging on the bank next to the road that ran eastward from the city of Belatona: eastward through fields of ripe, verdant crops; over a wide stone bridge that arched across the Jiet River; and then around the southernmost point of Leona Lake. There the road branched, one fork turning to the right, toward the Burning Plains and Surda, the other turning north, toward Dras-Leona and eventually Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Thousands of men, dwarves, and Urgals milled about before Belatona’s eastern gate, as well as within the city itself, arguing and shouting as the Varden tried to organize itself into a cohesive unit. In addition to the ragtag blocks of warriors on foot, there was King Orrin’s cavalry—a mass of prancing, snorting horses. And strung out behind the fighting part of the army was the supply train: a mile-and-a-half-long line of carts, wagons, and wheeled pens, flanked by the vast herds of horned cattle the Varden had brought from Surda and supplemented by what animals they had been able to appropriate from farmers along their path. From the herds and the supply train came the lowing of oxen, the braying of mules and donkeys, the honking of geese, and the whinnies and neighs of draft horses.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was enough to make Eragon want to plug his ears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You would think we would be better at this, considering how many times we’ve done it before</span>, he commented to Saphira as he hopped down off the boulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She sniffed. <span class="italic">They ought to put me in charge; I could scare them into <span>position</span> in less than an hour, and then we wouldn’t have to waste so much time waiting</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The thought amused him. <span class="italic">Yes, I’m sure you could. … Be careful what you say, though, or Nasuada might just make you do it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon’s mind turned to Roran, whom he had not seen since the night he had healed Horst and Elain’s child, and he wondered how his cousin was doing and worried about leaving him so far behind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Blasted fool thing to do,” Eragon muttered, remembering how Roran had left without letting him renew his wards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">He’s an experienced hunter</span>, Saphira pointed out. <span class="italic">He will not be so foolish as to allow his prey to claw him</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I know, but sometimes it can’t be helped. … He had best be careful, that’s all. I don’t want him to come back a cripple or, worse, wrapped in a shroud</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A grim mood descended upon Eragon, then he shook himself and bounced up and down on his feet, restless and eager to do something physical before spending the next few hours sitting on Saphira. He welcomed the opportunity to fly with her, but he disliked the prospect of being tethered to the same twelve or so miles for the whole day, circling vulture-like over the slow-moving troops. On their own, he and Saphira could have reached Dras-Leona by late that very afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He trotted away from the road to a relatively flat stretch of grass. There, ignoring the looks from Arya and the rest of the elves, he drew Brisingr and assumed the on-guard position Brom had first taught him so long ago. He inhaled slowly and settled into a low stance, feeling the texture of the ground through the soles of his boots.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a short, hard exclamation, he swept the sword up around his head and brought it down in a slanting blow that would have halved any man, elf, or Urgal, regardless of their armor. He stopped the sword less than an inch above the ground and held it there, the blade trembling ever so slightly in his grip. Against the backdrop of the grass, the blue of the metal appeared vivid, almost unreal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon inhaled again and lunged forward, stabbing the air as if it were a deadly enemy. One by one, he practiced the basic moves of sword fighting, focusing not so much on speed or strength but on precision.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he was pleasantly warm from his skill work, he glanced round at his guards, who stood in a semicircle some distance away. “Will one of you cross swords with me for a few minutes?” he asked, raising his voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elves looked at one another, their expressions unreadable; then the elf Wyrden stepped forward. “I will, Shadeslayer, if it pleases you. However, I would ask that you wear your helm while we spar.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Agreed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon returned Brisingr to its sheath, then ran to Saphira and clambered up her side, cutting the pad of his left thumb on one of her scales as he did so. He was wearing his mail tunic, and his greaves and bracers too, but he had stowed his helm in one of the saddlebags, so that it would not roll off Saphira and become lost in the grass.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he retrieved the helm, he saw the casket that contained Glaedr’s heart of hearts wrapped in a blanket and nestled at the bottom of the saddlebag. He reached down and touched the knotted bundle, silently paying tribute to what remained of the majestic golden dragon, then closed the saddlebag and swung down from Saphira’s back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon donned his arming cap and helm as he strode back to the greensward. He licked the blood off his thumb, then pulled on his gauntlets, hoping that the cut would not bleed too much into the glove. Using slight variations of the same spell, he and Wyrden placed thin barriers—invisible, save for the faint, rippling distortion they caused in the air—over the edges of their swords, so they could not cut anything. They also lowered the wards that protected them from physical danger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he and Wyrden took up positions opposite each other, <span>bowed</span>, and raised their blades. Eragon stared into the elf’s black, unblinking eyes, even as Wyrden stared at him. Keeping his gaze fixed on his opponent, Eragon felt his way forward and tried to inch around Wyrden’s right side, where the right-handed elf would have more difficulty defending himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elf slowly turned, crushing the grass beneath his heels as he kept his front oriented toward Eragon. After a few more steps, Eragon stopped. Wyrden was too alert and too experienced for Eragon to flank him; he would never catch the elf off balance. <span class="italic">Unless, of course, I can distract him</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">But before he could decide how to proceed, Wyrden feinted toward Eragon’s right leg, as if to skewer him in the knee, then in midstroke, changed directions, twisting his wrist and arm to slash Eragon across his chest and neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Fast as the elf was, Eragon was faster still. As he spotted the shift in Wyrden’s posture that betrayed his intentions, Eragon retreated a half step while bending his elbow and whipping his sword up past his face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ha!” shouted Eragon as he caught Wyrden’s sword on Brisingr. The blades produced a piercing <span class="italic">clang</span> as they collided.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With an effort, Eragon shoved Wyrden back, then leaped after him, battering him with a series of furious blows.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For several minutes, they fought upon the sward. Eragon landed the first touch—a light rap on Wyrden’s hip—and the second as well, but thereafter, their duel was more equally matched, as the elf got the measure of him and began to anticipate his patterns of attack and defense. Eragon rarely had the opportunity to test himself against anyone as fast or strong as Wyrden, so he enjoyed the contest with the elf.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His pleasure, however, vanished when Wyrden landed four touches in quick succession: one on Eragon’s right shoulder, two on his ribs, and a wicked draw cut across his abdomen. The blows smarted, but Eragon’s pride smarted even more. It worried him that the elf had been able to slip past his guard so easily. If they had been <span>fighting</span> in earnest, Eragon knew that he would have been able to defeat Wyrden in their first few exchanges, but that thought was of little comfort.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You shouldn’t let him hit you so much</span>, observed Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, I realize that</span>, he growled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Do you want me to knock him over for you</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No … not today</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His mood soured, Eragon lowered his blade and thanked Wyrden for sparring. The elf bowed and said, “You’re welcome, Shadeslayer,” then returned to his place among his comrades.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon planted Brisingr in the ground between his boots—something he never would have done with a sword made of ordinary steel—and rested his hands on the pommel while he watched the men and animals jostling within the confines of the road that led from the vast stone city. The turbulence within the ranks had diminished substantially, and he guessed that it would not be long before the horns signaled the Varden to advance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the meantime, he was still restless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He looked over at Arya, where she stood next to Saphira, and a smile gradually spread across his face. Resting Brisingr on his shoulder, he sauntered over and motioned toward her sword. “Arya, what about you? We’ve only sparred together that one time in Farthen Dûr.” His grin widened, and he flourished Brisingr. “I’ve gotten a bit better since then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“So you have.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What say you, then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She cast a critical glance toward the Varden, then shrugged. “Why not?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they walked to the level patch of grass, he said, “You won’t be able to best me quite so easily as before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I am sure you are right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya prepared her sword, then they faced each other, some thirty feet apart. Feeling confident, Eragon advanced swiftly, already knowing where he was going to strike: at her left shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya held her ground and made no attempt to evade him. When he was less than four yards away, she smiled at him, a warm, brilliant smile that so enhanced her beauty, Eragon faltered, his thoughts dissolving into a muddle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A line of steel flashed toward him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He belatedly lifted Brisingr to deflect the blow. A jolt ran up his arm as the tip of the sword glanced off something solid—hilt, blade, or flesh he was not sure, but whatever it was, he knew that he had misjudged the distance and that his response had left him open to attack.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before he could do much more than slow his forward momentum, another impact dashed his sword arm to the side; then a knot of pain formed in his midsection as Arya stabbed him, knocking him to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon grunted as he landed on his back and the air rushed out of him. He gaped at the sky and tried to inhale, but his abdomen was cramped as hard as a stone, and he could not draw air into his lungs. A constellation of crimson spots appeared before his eyes, and for a few uncomfortable seconds, he feared he would lose consciousness. Then his muscles released, and with a loud gasp, he resumed breathing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once his head cleared, he slowly got back to his feet, using Brisingr for support. He leaned on the sword, standing hunched like an old man while he waited for the ache in his stomach to subside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You cheated,” he said between gritted teeth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, I exploited a weakness in my opponent. There is a difference.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You think … that is a <span class="italic">weakness</span>?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“When we fight, yes. Do you wish to continue?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He answered by yanking Brisingr out of the sod, marching back to where he had started, and raising his sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Good,” said Arya. She mirrored his pose.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">This time Eragon was much more wary as he closed with her, <span>and</span> Arya did not stay in the same place. With careful steps, she advanced, her clear green eyes never leaving him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She twitched, and Eragon flinched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He realized he was holding his breath and forced himself to relax.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Another step forward, then he swung with all his speed and might.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She blocked his cut to her ribs and replied with a jab toward his exposed armpit. The blunted edge of her sword slid across the back of his free hand, scraping against the mail sewn onto his gauntlet as he slapped the blade away. At that moment, Arya’s torso was exposed, but they were too close for Eragon to effectively slash or stab.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Instead, he lunged forward and struck at her breastbone with the pommel of his sword, thinking to knock her to the ground, as she had done to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She twisted out of the way, and the pommel went through the space where she had been as Eragon stumbled forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without knowing quite how it had happened, he found himself standing motionless with one of Arya’s arms wrapped around his neck and the cool, slippery surface of her spell-bound blade pressed against the side of his jaw.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From behind him, Arya whispered into his right ear, “I could have removed your head as easily as plucking an apple from a tree.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then she released her hold and shoved him away. Angry, he whirled around and saw that she was already waiting for him, her sword at the ready and her expression determined.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Giving in to his anger, Eragon sprang after her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Four blows they exchanged, each more terrible than the last. Arya struck first, chopping at his legs. He parried and slashed crosswise at her waist, but she skipped out of reach of Brisingr’s glittering, sunlit edge. Without giving her an opportunity to retaliate, he followed up with a looping underhand cut, which she blocked with deceptive ease. Then she stepped forward and, with a touch as light as a hummingbird’s wing, drew her sword across his belly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya held her position at the conclusion of the stroke, her face mere inches from his. Her forehead glistened and her cheeks were flushed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With exaggerated care, they disengaged.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon straightened his tunic, then squatted next to Arya. His battle rage had burned itself out and left him focused, if not entirely at ease.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t understand,” he said quietly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You have become too accustomed to fighting Galbatorix’s soldiers. They cannot hope to match you, so you take chances that would otherwise prove your undoing. Your attacks are too obvious—you should not rely on brute strength—and you have grown lax in your defense.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Will you help me?” he asked. “Will you spar with me when you can?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded. “Of course. But if I cannot, then go to Blödhgarm for instruction; he is as skilled with a blade as I am. Practice is the only remedy you need, practice with the proper partners.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon had just opened his mouth to thank her when he felt the presence of a consciousness other than Saphira’s pressing against his mind, vast and frightening and filled with the most profound melancholy: a sadness so great, Eragon’s throat tightened and the colors of the world seemed to lose their luster. And, in a slow, deep voice, as if speaking was a struggle of almost unbearable proportions, the golden dragon Glaedr said:</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You must learn … to see what you are looking at</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the presence vanished, leaving behind a black void.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked at Arya. She appeared as stricken as he was; she had heard Glaedr’s words as well. Beyond her, Blödhgarm and the other elves stirred and murmured, while by the edge of the road, Saphira craned her neck as she tried to look at the saddlebags tied to her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They had all heard, Eragon realized.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Together he and Arya rose from the ground and sprinted over <span>to</span> Saphira, who said, <span class="italic">He will not answer me; wherever he was, he has returned, and he will not listen to anything but his sorrow. Here, see</span>. …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon joined his mind with hers, and with Arya’s, and the three of them reached out with their thoughts toward Glaedr’s heart of hearts, where it lay hidden within the saddlebags. What remained of the dragon felt more robust than before, but his mind was still closed to outside communication, his consciousness listless and indifferent, as it had been ever since Galbatorix slew his Rider, Oromis.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon, Saphira, and Arya tried to rouse the dragon from his stupor. However, Glaedr steadfastly ignored them, taking no more notice of them than a sleeping cave bear might of a few flies buzzing around his head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And yet Eragon could not help but think that Glaedr’s indifference was not as complete as it seemed, given his comment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last the three of them admitted defeat and withdrew to their respective bodies. As Eragon returned to himself, Arya said, “Perhaps if we could touch his Eldunarí …?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon sheathed Brisingr, then hopped onto Saphira’s right foreleg and pulled himself into the saddle perched on the crest of her shoulders. He twisted round in his seat and began to work on the buckles of the saddlebags.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He had unfastened one of the buckles and was picking at the other when the brazen call of a horn rang forth from the head of the Varden, sounding the advance. At the signal, the vast train of men and animals lurched forward, their movements hesitant at first, but becoming smoother and more confident with every step.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon glanced down at Arya, torn. She solved his dilemma by waving and saying, “Tonight, we will speak tonight. Go! Fly with the wind!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He quickly rebuckled the saddlebag, then slid his legs through the rows of straps on either side of the saddle and pulled them tight, so he would not fall off Saphira in midair.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Saphira crouched and, with a roar of joy, leaped out over the road. The men below her ducked and cringed, and horses bolted <span>as</span> she unfurled her huge wings and flapped, driving herself away from the hard, unfriendly ground, up into the smooth expanse of the sky.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon closed his eyes and tilted his face up, glad to finally be leaving Belatona. After spending a week in the city with nothing to do but eat and rest—for so Nasuada had insisted—he was eager to resume their journey toward Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Saphira leveled off, hundreds of feet above the peaks and towers of the city, he said, <span class="italic">Will Glaedr recover, do you think</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">He will never be as he was</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No, but I hope that he will find a way to overcome his grief. I need his help, Saphira. There are so many things I still don’t know. Without him, I have no one else to ask</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She was silent for a while, the only sound that of her wings. <span class="italic">We cannot hurry him</span>, she said. <span class="italic">He has been hurt in the worst way a dragon or Rider can be. Before he can help you, me, or anyone else, he must decide that he wants to continue living. Until he does, our words cannot reach him</span>.</span></p>
