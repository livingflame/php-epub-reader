<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">WHEN HE AND</span></span> Saphira arrived at Urû’baen, Eragon was surprised to discover that Nasuada had restored its name to Ilirea, out of respect for its history and heritage.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Also, he was dismayed to learn that Arya had departed for Ellesméra, along with Däthedr and many of the other high elf lords, and that she had taken with her the green dragon egg they had found in the citadel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She had left a letter for him with Nasuada. In it, Arya explained that she needed to accompany her mother’s body back to Du Weldenvarden for a proper burial. As for the dragon egg, she wrote:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">… and because Saphira chose you, a human, to be her Rider, it is only right that an elf should be the next Rider, if the dragon within this egg agrees. I wish to give it that chance without delay. Already, it has spent far too long within its shell. Since there are many more eggs elsewhere—I shall not name the place—I hope you do not believe that I have acted presumptuously or that I have been overly prejudiced in favor of my own race. I consulted with the Eldunarí upon this matter, and they agreed with my decision</span>.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre31"><p class="calibre32"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">In any event, with both Galbatorix and my mother having passed into the void, I no longer wish to continue as ambassador to the Varden. Rather, I wish to resume my task of ferrying a dragon egg throughout the land, as I did with Saphira’s. Of course, an ambassador between our races is still needed. Therefore, Däthedr and I have appointed as my replacement a young elf named Vanir, whom you met during your time in <span>Ellesm</span>éra. He has expressed a desire to learn more about the people of your race, and that seems to me as good a reason as any for him to have the post—so long as he does not prove completely incompetent, that is</span>.</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The letter continued for several more lines, but Arya gave no indication of when, if ever, she might return to the western half of Alagaësia. Eragon was pleased that she had thought enough of him to write, but he wished that she could have waited until their return before she had departed. With her gone, there was a hole in his world, and though he spent a fair amount of time with Roran and Katrina, as well as Nasuada, the aching emptiness within him refused to subside. That, along with his continued sense that he and Saphira were merely biding their time, left him with a feeling of detachment. It often seemed as if he were watching himself from outside his body, as might a stranger. He understood the cause of his feelings, but he could think of no cure other than time.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">During their recent trip, it had occurred to him that—with the command of the ancient language bestowed by the name of names—he could remove from Elva the last vestiges of his blessing that had proved a curse. So he went to the girl, where she was living in Nasuada’s grand hall, and he told her his idea, then asked her what she wanted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She did not react with the delight he expected, but sat staring at the floor, a frown upon her pale face. She remained silent for the better part of an hour—he sitting across from her, waiting without complaint.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then she looked at him and said, “No. I would rather stay as I am. … I am grateful that you thought to ask, but this is too large a part of me, and I cannot give it up. Without my ability to sense others’ pain, I would be only an oddity—a misbegotten aberration, good for nothing but satisfying the low-minded curiosity of those who consented to have me around, of those who <span class="italic">tolerated</span> me. With <span>it</span>, I am still an oddity, but I can be useful as well, and I have a power that others fear and a control over my own destiny, which many of my sex do not.” She gestured at the ornate room where she was staying. “Here I can live in comfort—I can live in peace—and yet I can continue to do some good by helping Nasuada. If you take away my ability, then what would I have? What would I do? What would I be? To remove your spell would be no blessing, Eragon. No, I will stay as I am, and I will bear the trials of my gift of my own free will. But I do thank you.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Two days after he and Saphira alit in what was now Ilirea, Nasuada sent them out once more, first to Gil’ead and then to Ceunon—the two cities that the elves had captured—so that Eragon could again use the name of names to clear away Galbatorix’s spells.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Both Eragon and Saphira found Gil’ead unpleasant to visit. It reminded them of when the Urgals had captured Eragon at Durza’s orders, and also of Oromis’s death.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon and Saphira slept in Ceunon for three nights. It was unlike any other city they had seen before. The buildings were mainly wood, with steep, shingled roofs that, in the case of the larger houses, had several layers. The peaks of the roofs were often decorated with a stylized carving of a dragon head, while the doors were carved or painted with elaborate, knotlike patterns.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When they departed, Saphira was the one who suggested a change of path. She did not have to try very hard to convince Eragon; he was happy to agree once she explained that the side trip would not take too long.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From Ceunon, Saphira flew westward, across the Bay of Fundor: a broad, white-capped expanse of water. The gray and black humps of great sea-fish often breached the waves, like small, leathery islands. Then they would spray water from their blowholes and lift their flukes high into the air before slipping back into the silent depths.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Across the Bay of Fundor, through winds cold and blustery, and then across the mountains of the Spine, each of which Eragon knew <span>by</span> name. And thus to Palancar Valley for the first time since they had set off in pursuit of the Ra’zac, along with Brom, what seemed like a lifetime ago.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The valley smelled like home to Eragon; the scent of the pines and the willows and the birches reminded him of his childhood, and the bitter bite of the air told him that winter was near.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They landed in the charred ruins of Carvahall, and Eragon wandered along streets fringed with encroaching grass and weeds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A pack of wild dogs trotted out of a nearby stand of birch. They stopped when they saw Saphira, then snarled, yelped, and ran for cover. Saphira growled and loosed a puff of smoke but made no move to chase them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A piece of burnt wood cracked under Eragon’s foot as he dragged his boot through a pile of ashes. The destruction of the town left him saddened. But most of the villagers who had escaped were still alive. If they returned, Eragon knew that they would rebuild Carvahall and make it better than it had been. The buildings he had grown up with, though, were gone forever. Their absence exacerbated his feeling that he no longer belonged in Palancar Valley, and the empty spaces where they ought to have been left him with a sense of wrongness, as if he were in a dream where everything was off-kilter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The world is out of joint,” he murmured.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon built a small campfire next to what had been Morn’s tavern, and he cooked a large pot of stew. While he ate, Saphira prowled the surrounding landscape, sniffing at whatever she found interesting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When the stew was gone, Eragon carried his pot, bowl, and spoon to the Anora River and washed them in the icy water. He sat squatting on the rocky shore and stared at the drifting white plume at the head of the valley: the Igualda Falls, which stretched upward for a half mile before disappearing over a shoulder of stone high on Narnmor Mountain. Seeing it brought back the evening he had returned from the Spine with Saphira’s egg in his pack, knowing <span>nothing</span> of what lay before the two of them, or even that there would <span class="italic">be</span> two of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Let’s go,” he said to Saphira, rejoining her by the caved-in well in the center of the town.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Do you want to visit your farm</span>? she asked as he took his place on her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He shook his head. “No. I would rather think of it as it was, not as it is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She agreed. However, by unspoken consent she flew south following the same path as when they had left Palancar Valley. Along the way, Eragon glimpsed the clearing where his home had been, but it was distant and obscure enough that he was able to pretend that perhaps the house and barn were still intact.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the southern end of the valley, Saphira rode a pillar of rising air up to the top of the huge, bare mountain, Utgard, where stood the crumbling turret the Riders had built to keep watch over mad King Palancar. The turret had once been known as Edoc’sil, but now bore the name Ristvak’baen, or the “Place of Sorrow,” as it was there that Galbatorix had slain Vrael.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the ruins of the turret, Eragon, Saphira, and the Eldunarí with them paid their respects to the memory of Vrael. Umaroth in particular was somber, but he said, <span class="italic">Thank you for bringing me here, Saphira. I never thought to see the place where my Rider fell</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Saphira spread her wings and leaped out of the turret and soared away from the valley and over the grassy plains beyond.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Halfway to Ilirea, Nasuada contacted them through one of the Varden’s magicians and ordered them to join a large group of warriors she had sent to march from the capital to Teirm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was pleased to learn that Roran commanded the warriors and that among their ranks were Jeod, Baldor—who had regained full use of his hand after the elves reattached it—and several more of the villagers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Somewhat to Eragon’s surprise, the people of Teirm refused <span>to</span> surrender, even after he released them from their oaths to Galbatorix, and even though it was obvious that the Varden, with Saphira and Eragon to help, could easily capture the city if they wished. Instead, the governor of Teirm, Lord Risthart, demanded that they be allowed to become an independent city-state with the freedom to choose its own rulers and set its own laws.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the end, after several days of negotiations, Nasuada agreed to his terms, provided that Lord Risthart swore allegiance to her as high queen, even as King Orrin had, and consented to abide by her laws concerning magicians.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From Teirm, Eragon and Saphira accompanied the warriors south, along the narrow coast, until they arrived at the city of Kuasta. They repeated the process from Teirm, but unlike Teirm, the governor of Kuasta yielded and agreed to join Nasuada’s new kingdom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon and Saphira flew alone to Narda, far to the north, and extracted the same promise from them before finally returning to Ilirea, where they stayed for some weeks in a hall next to Nasuada’s.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When time allowed, he and Saphira left the city and went to the castle, where Blödhgarm and the other spellcasters guarded the Eldunarí rescued from Galbatorix. There Eragon and Saphira aided in the effort to heal the minds of the dragons. They made progress, but it was slow, and some of the Eldunarí responded faster than others. Many of them, Eragon worried, simply did not care about life anymore, or were so lost within the labyrinths of their minds that it was almost impossible to communicate with them in a meaningful manner, even for the elder dragons such as Valdr. To prevent the hundreds of maddened dragons from overwhelming those who were trying to help them, the elves kept most of the Eldunarí in a trancelike state, choosing to interact with only a few at a time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon also labored alongside the magicians of Du Vrangr Gata to empty the citadel of its treasures. Much of the work fell to him, as none of the other spellcasters had the knowledge or experience <span>needed</span> to deal with many of the enchanted artifacts Galbatorix had left behind. But Eragon did not mind; he enjoyed exploring the damaged fortress and discovering the secrets that lay hidden therein. Galbatorix had collected a host of wonders over the past century, some more dangerous than others, but all of them interesting. Eragon’s favorite was an astrolabe that, when put to his eye, allowed him to see the stars, even in daylight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He kept the existence of the most perilous artifacts a secret between him, Saphira, and Nasuada, deeming it too risky to allow knowledge of them to spread.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada put the trove of riches they recovered from the citadel to immediate use feeding and clothing her warriors, as well as rebuilding the defenses of the cities they had captured during their invasion of the Empire. In addition, she gave a gift of five gold crowns to every one of her subjects: a trifling amount to the nobles, but a veritable fortune to the poorer farmers. The gesture, Eragon knew, earned her their respect and allegiance in a way Galbatorix would never have understood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They also recovered several hundred Riders’ swords: swords of every color and shape, made for both humans and elves. It was a breathtaking find. Eragon and Saphira personally carried the weapons to the castle where the Eldunarí were, in anticipation of the day when they would again be needed by Riders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Rhunön, Eragon thought, would be pleased to know that so much of her handiwork had survived.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And there were the thousands of scrolls and books that Galbatorix had collected, which the elves and Jeod helped to catalog, setting aside those that contained secrets about the Riders or the inner workings of magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they sorted through Galbatorix’s great hoard of knowledge, Eragon kept hoping that they would find some mention of where the king had hidden the rest of the Lethrblaka’s eggs. However, the only mentions of the Lethrblaka or the Ra’zac he saw were in works <span>by</span> the elves and the Riders from ages past, where they discussed the dark menace of the night and wondered what was to be done about a foe that could not be detected with magic of any sort.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Now that Eragon could speak openly with him, he found himself talking with Jeod on a regular basis, confiding in him all that had happened with the Eldunarí and the eggs, and even going so far as to tell him about the process of finding his true name on Vroengard. Talking with Jeod was a comfort, especially as he was one of the few people who had known Brom well enough to call him a friend.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Eragon found it interesting, in a rather abstract way, to watch what went into ruling and rebuilding the kingdom Nasuada had formed from the remnants of the Empire. The amount of effort required to manage such an enormous and diverse country was tremendous, and the task never seemed finished; there was always more that needed doing. Eragon knew that he would have hated the demands of the position, but Nasuada appeared to thrive upon them. Her energy never flagged, and she always seemed to know how to solve the problems that came before her. Day by day, he saw her stature grow among the emissaries, functionaries, nobles, and commoners with whom she dealt. She seemed perfectly suited for her new role, although he was not sure how happy she really was, and he worried about her because of it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He watched how she rendered judgment upon the nobles who had worked with Galbatorix—willingly or not—and he approved of the fairness and mercy she displayed, as well as the punishments she meted out when necessary. Most she stripped of their lands, titles, and the better portion of their ill-gotten wealth, but she did not have them executed, for which Eragon was glad.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He stood by her side when she granted Nar Garzhvog and his people vast swaths of land along the northern coast of the Spine, as well as along the fertile plains between the lake Fläm and the Toark River, where few if any people now lived. And that too Eragon approved of.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Like King Orrin and Lord Risthart, Nar Garzhvog had sworn fealty to Nasuada as his high queen. However, the huge Kull said, “My people agree with this, Lady Nightstalker, but they have thick blood and short memories, and words will not bind them forever.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In a cold voice, Nasuada replied, “Do you mean to say your people will break the peace? Am I to understand our races will once again be enemies?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Garzhvog, and shook his massive head. “We do not want to fight you. We know that Firesword would kill us. But … when our young ones have grown, they will want battles in which to prove themselves. If there are no battles, then they will start them. I am sorry, Nightstalker, but we cannot change what we are.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The exchange troubled Eragon—and Nasuada as well—and he spent several nights thinking about the Urgals, trying to solve the problem they presented.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">As the weeks rolled by, Nasuada continued to send him and Saphira to various locations within Surda and her kingdom, often using them as her personal representatives to King Orrin, Lord Risthart, and the other nobles and groups of soldiers throughout the land.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Wherever they went, they searched for a place that could serve as a home for the Eldunarí in the centuries to come and as nesting and proving grounds for the dragons hidden on Vroengard. There were areas of the Spine that showed promise, but most were too close to humans or Urgals, or else were so far north, Eragon thought it would be miserable to live there year-round. Besides, Murtagh and Thorn had gone north, and Eragon and Saphira did not want to cause them additional difficulty.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The Beor Mountains would have been perfect, but it seemed doubtful that the dwarves would welcome hundreds of ravenous dragons hatching within the bounds of their realm. No matter where they went in the Beors, they would still be a short flight from at least one dwarven city, and it would not do if a young dragon were <span>to</span> start raiding the dwarves’ flocks of Feldûnost—which, knowing Saphira, Eragon deemed more than likely.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elves would, he thought, have no objection to the dragons living on or around one of the mountains in Du Weldenvarden, but Eragon still worried about their nearness to the elven cities. Also, he disliked the idea of placing the dragons and the Eldunarí within the territory of any one race. Doing so would give the appearance that they were lending support to that race in particular. The Riders of the past had never done that, nor—Eragon believed—should the Riders of the future.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The only location that was far enough away from every town and city and that no race had yet claimed was the ancestral home of the dragons: the heart of the Hadarac Desert, where stood Du Fells Nángoröth, the Blasted Mountains. It would, Eragon was sure, be a fine place to raise hatchlings. However, it had three drawbacks. First, they would not be able to find enough food in the desert to feed the young dragons. Saphira would have to spend most of her time carrying deer and other wild animals to the mountains. And of course, once the hatchlings grew larger, they would have to start flying out on their own, which would take them close to the lands of either the humans, the elves, or the dwarves. Second, everyone who had traveled widely—and many who had not—knew where the mountains were. And third, it was not unduly difficult to reach the mountains, especially in the winter. The last two points concerned Eragon the most and made him wonder how well they would be able to protect the eggs, the hatchlings, and the Eldunarí.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It would be better if we were high up on one of the peaks in the Beors, where only a dragon could fly</span>, he said to Saphira. <span class="italic">Then no one would be able to sneak up on us, no one except for Thorn, Murtagh, or some other magician</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Some other magician, like every elf in the land? Besides, it would be cold all the time!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I thought you didn’t mind the cold</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">I don’t. But I don’t want to live in the snow year-round either. Sand is <span>better</span> for your scales; Glaedr told me. It helps polish them and keep them clean.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Mmh</span>.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Day by day, the weather grew colder. Trees shed their leaves, flocks of birds flew south for the year, and winter thus came upon the land. It was a cruel, harsh winter, and for a long while it felt as if the whole of Alagaësia was locked in slumber. At the first fall of snow, Orik and his army returned to the Beor Mountains. All of the elves who were still in Ilirea—save Vanir and Blödhgarm and his ten spellcasters—likewise left for Du Weldenvarden. The Urgals had departed weeks earlier. Last to go were the werecats. They seemed to simply disappear; no one saw them leave, and yet one day they were all gone, except for a large, fat werecat by the name of Yelloweyes, who sat on the padded cushion next to Nasuada, purring, napping, and listening to everything that went on in the throne room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without the elves and the dwarves, the city felt depressingly empty to Eragon as he walked along the streets, ragged flakes of snow drifting sideways underneath the shelf of creviced stone overhead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And still Nasuada continued to dispatch him and Saphira upon missions. But never did she send them to Du Weldenvarden, the one place Eragon wanted to go. They had had no word from the elves as to who had been chosen as Islanzadí’s successor, and when asked, Vanir would only say, “We are not a hasty people, and for us, appointing a new monarch is a difficult, complicated process. As soon as I learn what our councils have decided, I will tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It had been so long since Eragon had seen or heard from Arya, he considered using the name of the ancient language to bypass the wards around Du Weldenvarden so that he could communicate with, or at least scry, her. However, he knew the elves would not look kindly on the intrusion, and he feared Arya would not appreciate him contacting her in that way without a pressing need.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Therefore, he instead wrote her a short letter, asking after her <span>and</span> telling her some of what he and Saphira had been doing. He gave the letter to Vanir, and Vanir promised that he would have it sent to Arya at once. Eragon was sure that Vanir kept his word—for they had been speaking in the ancient language—but he received no response from Arya, and as the moons waxed and waned, he began to think that, for some unknown reason, she had decided to end their friendship. The thought hurt him terribly, and it caused him to concentrate on the work Nasuada gave him with even greater intensity, hoping to forget his misery.</span></p>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">In the deepest part of winter, when swordlike icicles hung from the shelf above Ilirea and deep drifts of snow lay upon the surrounding landscape, when the roads were nearly impassable and the fare at their tables had grown lean, three attempts were made on Nasuada’s life, as Murtagh had warned might happen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The attempts were clever and well thought out, and the third one—which involved a net full of stones falling on Nasuada—nearly succeeded. But with Eragon’s wards and Elva to protect her, Nasuada survived, although the last attack cost her several broken bones.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">During the third attempt, Eragon and the Nighthawks managed to kill two of Nasuada’s attackers—the exact number of which remained a mystery—but the rest escaped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon and Jörmundur went to extraordinary lengths to ensure Nasuada’s safety after that. They increased the number of her guards once again, and wherever she went, at least three spellcasters accompanied her. Nasuada herself grew ever more wary, and Eragon saw in her a certain hardness that had not been apparent before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There were no more attacks upon Nasuada’s person, but a month after winter broke and the roads were again clear, a displaced earl by the name of Hamlin, who had gathered up several hundred of the Empire’s former soldiers, started launching raids against Gil’ead and attacking the travelers on the roads thereabouts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the same time, another, slightly larger rebellion began to brew in the south, led by Tharos the Quick of Aroughs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The uprisings were more of a nuisance than anything, but they still took several months to quell, and they resulted in a number of unexpectedly savage fights, although Eragon and Saphira attempted to settle matters peacefully whenever they could. After the battles they had already participated in, neither of them was thirsty for more blood.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Soon after the end of the uprisings, Katrina gave birth to a large, healthy girl with a lock of red hair atop her head, the same as her mother. The girl bawled louder than any infant Eragon had ever heard, and she had a grip like iron. Roran and Katrina named her Ismira, after Katrina’s mother, and whenever they looked at her, the joy in their faces made Eragon grin as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The day after Ismira’s birth, Nasuada summoned Roran to her throne room and surprised him by granting him the title of earl, along with the whole of Palancar Valley as his domain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“As long as you and your descendants remain fit to rule, the valley shall be yours,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran bowed and said, “Thank you, Your Majesty.” The gift, Eragon could see, meant almost as much to Roran as had the birth of his daughter, for after his family, the thing Roran prized most was his home.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada also tried to give Eragon various titles and lands, but he refused them, saying, “It is enough to be a Rider; I need nothing more.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">A few days later, Eragon was standing with Nasuada in her study, examining a map of Alagaësia and discussing matters of concern throughout the land, when she said, “Now that things are somewhat more settled, I think it’s time to address the role of magicians within Surda, Teirm, and my own kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes. I’ve spent a great deal of time thinking about it and have reached a decision. I have decided to form a group, much like the Riders, but for magicians alone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And what will this group do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada picked up a quill from her desk and rolled it between her fingers. “Again, much the same as the Riders: travel through the land, keep the peace, resolve disputes of law, and most important, watch over their fellow spellcasters, so as to ensure they do not use their ability for ill.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon frowned slightly. “Why not just leave that to the Riders?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Because it will be years before we have more of them, and even then there won’t be enough to mind every petty conjurer and hedge witch. … You still haven’t found a place to raise the dragons, have you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shook his head. Both he and Saphira had been feeling increasingly impatient, but as of yet, they and the Eldunarí had been unable to agree upon a location. It was becoming a sore point between them, for the infant dragons needed to hatch as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I thought not. We have to do this, Eragon, and we cannot afford to wait. Look at the havoc Galbatorix wrought. Magicians are the most dangerous creatures in this world, even more dangerous than dragons, and they have to be held accountable. If not, we’ll always be at their mercy.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you really believe you will be able to recruit enough magicians to watch over all of the other spellcasters here and in Surda?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I think so, if <span class="italic">you</span> ask them to join. Which is one of the reasons I want you to lead this group.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded. “Who else? Trianna? I don’t fully trust her, nor does she have the strength needed. An elf? No, it has to be one of our own. You know the name of the ancient language, you’re a Rider, and you have the wisdom and authority of the dragons behind you. <span>I</span> cannot think of a better person to lead the spellcasters. I’ve spoken to Orrin about this, and he agrees.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I can’t imagine the idea pleases him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, but he understands that it is necessary.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Is it?” Eragon picked at the edge of her desk, troubled. “How do you intend to keep watch over the magicians who don’t belong to this group?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I hoped you might have some suggestions. I thought perhaps with spells and scrying mirrors, so that we could track their whereabouts and supervise their use of magic, lest they use it to better themselves at the expense of others.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And if they do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then we see to it that they make amends for their crime, and we have them swear in the ancient language to give up the use of magic.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oaths in the ancient language won’t necessarily stop anyone from using magic.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know, but it’s the best we can do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He nodded. “And what if a spellcaster refuses to be watched? What, then? I can’t imagine very many would agree to be spied upon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A sigh escaped Nasuada, and she put down her quill. “There’s the difficult part. What would you do, Eragon, if you were in my place?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">None of the solutions he thought of were very palatable. “I don’t know. …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her expression grew sad. “Nor do I. This is a difficult, painful, messy problem, and no matter what I choose, someone will end up hurt. If I do nothing, the magicians will remain free to manipulate others with their spells. If I force them to submit to oversight, many will hate me for it. However, I think you will agree with me that its better to protect the majority of my subjects at the expense of a few.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t like it,” he murmured.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t like it either.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re talking about binding every human spellcaster to your will, regardless of who they are.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She did not blink. “For the good of the many.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What about people who can only hear thoughts, and nothing more? That’s a form of magic as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Them too. The potential for them to abuse their power is still too great.” Nasuada sighed then. “I know this isn’t easy, Eragon, but easy or not, it’s something we have to address. Galbatorix was mad and evil, but he was right about one thing: the magicians need to be reined in. But not as Galbatorix intended. Something needs to be done, though, and I think my plan is the best solution possible. If you can think of another, better way to enforce the rule of law among spellcasters, I would be delighted. Otherwise, this is the only path available to us, and I need your help to do it. … So, will you accept charge of this group, for the good of the country, and the good of our race as a whole?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was slow to answer. At last he said, “If you don’t mind, I’d like to think about it for a while. And I need to consult with Saphira.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Of course. But don’t think for too long, Eragon. Preparations are already under way, and you will soon be needed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Afterward, Eragon did not return directly to Saphira but wandered through the streets of Ilirea, ignoring the bows and the greetings from the people he passed. He felt … uneasy, both with Nasuada’s proposal and with life in general. He and Saphira had been idling for too long. The time had come for a change, and circumstances would no longer allow them to wait. They had to decide what they were going to do, and whatever they chose, it would affect the rest of their lives.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He spent several hours walking and thinking, mainly about his ties and obligations. In late afternoon, he made his way back to Saphira and, without speaking, climbed onto her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She leaped out of the courtyard of the hall and flew high above <span>Ilirea</span>, high enough that they could see for hundreds of miles in every direction. There she stayed, circling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They spoke without words, exchanging their mind-states. Saphira shared many of his concerns, but she was not as worried as he about their bonds with others. Nothing was as important to her as protecting the eggs and the Eldunarí, and doing what was right for him and her. Yet Eragon knew that they could not just ignore the effects their choices would have, both political and personal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Finally, he said, <span class="italic">What should we do</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira dipped as the wind underneath her wings slowed. <span class="italic">What we need to do, as has always been the case</span>. She said nothing more, but turned then and began to descend toward the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon appreciated her silence. The decision would be harder for him to make than for her, and he needed to think about it on his own.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When they landed in the courtyard, Saphira nudged him with her snout and said, <span class="italic">If you need to talk, I’ll be here</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He smiled and rubbed the side of her neck, and then slowly walked to his rooms, while staring at the floor.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">That night, when the waxing moon had just appeared beneath the edge of the cliff over Ilirea and Eragon was sitting against the end of his bed, reading a book about the saddle-making techniques of the early Riders, a flicker by the edge of his sight—like the flapping of a drape—caught his attention.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He sprang to his feet, drawing Brisingr from its sheath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then, in his open window, he saw a small three-masted ship, woven from stalks of grass. He smiled and sheathed his sword. He held out his hand, and the ship sailed across the room and landed upon his palm, where it listed to one side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The ship was different from the one Arya had made during their travels together in the Empire, after he and Roran rescued Katrina from Helgrind. It had more masts, and it also had sails fashioned from the blades of grass. Though the grass was limp and browning, it <span>had</span> not dried out entirely, which led him to think that it had been picked only a day or two earlier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Tied to the middle of the deck was a square of folded paper. Eragon carefully removed it, his heart pounding, then unfolded the paper on the floor. It read, in glyphs of the ancient language:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Eragon</span>,</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre31"><p class="calibre32"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We have finally decided upon a leader, and I am on my way to Ilirea to arrange an introduction with Nasuada. I would like to talk with you and Saphira first. This message should reach you four days before the half moon. If you would, meet me the day after you receive it, at the easternmost point of the Ramr River. Come alone, and do not tell anyone else where you are going</span>.</span></p></blockquote>
<p class="calibre35"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Arya</span></span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon smiled without meaning to. Her timing had been perfect; the ship had arrived exactly when she intended. Then his smile faded, and he reread the letter several more times. She was hiding something; that much was obvious. But what? Why meet in secret?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Maybe Arya doesn’t approve of the elves’ next ruler</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">Or maybe there’s some other problem</span>. And though Eragon was eager to see her again, he could not forget how she had ignored him and Saphira. He supposed that, from Arya’s point of view, the intervening months were a trifling amount of time, but he could not help feeling hurt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He waited until the first hint of sunlight appeared in the sky, then hurried down to wake Saphira and tell her the news. She was as curious as he, if not quite as excited.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He saddled her, and then they left the city and set off to the northeast, having told no one of their plans, not even Glaedr or the other Eldunarí.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_160"></div></body>
