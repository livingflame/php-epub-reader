<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">THEY CAUGHT HER</span></span> at the intersection of two identical corridors, both lined with pillars and torches and scarlet pennants bearing the twisting gold flame that was Galbatorix’s insignia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada had not expected to escape, not really, but she could not help but feel disappointed at her failure. If nothing else, she had hoped to cover more distance before they recaptured her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She fought the whole way as the soldiers dragged her back to the chamber that had been her prison. The men wore chest plates and vambraces, but she still managed to scratch their faces and bite their hands, wounding a pair of the men rather severely.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The soldiers uttered exclamations of dismay when they entered the Hall of the Soothsayer and saw what she had done to her jailer. Careful not to step in the pooling blood, they carried her to the slab of stone, strapped her down, then hurried away, leaving her alone with the corpse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She shouted at the ceiling and yanked at her restraints, angry with herself for not having done better. Still simmering, she glanced at the body on the floor, then quickly looked away. In death, the man’s expression seemed accusatory, and she could not bear to gaze upon it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After she stole the spoon, she had spent hours grinding the end of the handle against the stone slab. The spoon had been made of soft iron, so it was easy to shape.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She had thought that Galbatorix and Murtagh would visit her next, but instead it was her jailer, bringing her what might have been a late dinner. He had started to undo her manacles in preparation for escorting her to the privy room. The moment he freed her <span>left</span> hand, she stabbed him underneath the chin with the sharpened handle of the spoon, burying the utensil in the folds of his wattle. The man squealed, a horrible, high-pitched sound that reminded her of a pig at slaughter, and spun thrice around, flailing his arms, then fell to the floor, where he lay thrashing and frothing and drumming his heels for what seemed an unreasonably long time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Killing him had troubled her. She did not think the man had been evil—she was not sure what he had been—but there had been a simpleness to him that made her feel as if she had taken advantage of him. Still, she had done what was necessary, and though she now found it unpleasant to consider, she remained convinced that her actions had been justified.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the man lay convulsing in his death throes, she had unfastened the rest of the restraints and jumped off the slab. Then, steeling her nerve, she pulled the spoon out of the man’s neck, which—like a stopper removed from the bung of a barrel—released a spray of blood that splattered her legs and caused her to jump backward while stifling a curse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The two guards outside the Hall of the Soothsayer had been easy enough to deal with. She had caught them by surprise and killed the right-hand guard in much the same way she had killed her jailer. Then she had drawn the dagger from the guard’s belt and attacked the other man even as he struggled to bring his pike to bear upon her. Up close, a pike was no match for a dagger, and she had unseamed him before he had a chance to escape or raise the alarm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She had not gotten very far after that. Whether because of Galbatorix’s spells or just plain bad luck, she ran headlong into a group of five soldiers, and they had quickly, if not easily, subdued her.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">It could not have been more than half an hour later when she heard a large group of men in iron-shod boots march up to the door of the chamber, and then Galbatorix stormed in, followed by several guards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As always, he stopped at the edge of her line of sight, and there <span>he</span> stood, a tall, dark figure with an angular face, only the outlines of which were visible. She saw his head turn as he took in the scene; then, in a cold voice, he said, “How did this happen?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A soldier with a plume on his helm scurried in front of Galbatorix, knelt, and held out her sharpened spoon. “Sire, we found this in one of the men outside.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king took the spoon and turned it over in his hands. “I see.” His head swiveled toward her. He gripped the ends of the spoon and, without discernible effort, bent it until it snapped in two. “You knew you could not escape, and yet you insisted upon trying. I’ll not have you killing my men merely to spite me. You have not the right to take their lives. You have not the right to do <span class="italic">anything</span> unless I allow it.” He flung the pieces of metal upon the floor. Then he turned and stalked out of the Hall of the Soothsayer, his heavy cape flapping behind him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Two of the soldiers removed her jailer’s body, then scoured the chamber of his blood, cursing her as they scrubbed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once they had left and she was again alone, she allowed herself a sigh, and some of the tension in her limbs vanished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She wished she had had a chance to eat, for now that the excitement was over, she found she was hungry. Worse, she suspected she would have to wait hours before she could hope to have her next meal, assuming that Galbatorix did not decide to punish her by withholding food.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her musings about bread and roasts and tall glasses of wine were short-lived, as she again heard the sound of many boots in the passageway outside her cell. Startled, she tried to mentally prepare herself for whatever unpleasantness was about to come, for it <span class="italic">would</span> be unpleasant, she was sure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The door to the chamber crashed open, and two sets of footsteps echoed in the octagonal room as Murtagh and Galbatorix walked over to her. Murtagh positioned himself where he usually did, but without the brazier to occupy himself, he crossed his arms, leaned against the wall, and glared at the floor. What she could see of his <span>expression</span> beneath his silver half mask did not comfort her; the lines of his face seemed even harder than normal, and there was something about the cast of his mouth that sent a chill of fear into her bones.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Instead of sitting, as was his wont, Galbatorix stood behind and somewhat to the side of her head, where she could feel his presence more than she could see it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He extended his long, clawlike hands over her. In them, he held a small box decorated with lines of carved horn that might have formed glyphs from the ancient language. Most disconcerting of all, a faint <span class="italic">skree-skree</span> sound came from within the container, soft as the scratching of a mouse, but no less distinct.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With the pad of his thumb, Galbatorix pushed open the box’s sliding lid. Then he reached inside and pulled out what appeared to be a large, ivory-colored maggot. The creature was almost three inches long, and it had a tiny mouth at one end, with which it uttered the <span class="italic">skree-skree</span> she had heard before, announcing its displeasure to the world. It was plump and pleated, like a caterpillar, but if it had any legs, they were so small as to be invisible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the creature wiggled in a vain attempt to free itself from between Galbatorix’s fingers, the king said, “This is a burrow grub. It is not what it appears to be. Few things are, but in the case of burrow grubs, that is all the more true. They are found in only one place in Alagaësia and are far more difficult to capture than you might suppose. Take it, then, as a sign of my regard for you, Nasuada, daughter of Ajihad, that I deign to use one on you.” His voice dropped in tone, becoming even more intimate. “I would not, however, wish to exchange places with you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The <span class="italic">skree-skree</span> of the burrow grub increased in volume as Galbatorix dropped it onto the bare skin of her right arm, just below the elbow. She flinched as the disgusting creature landed on her; it was heavier than it looked, and its underside gripped her with what felt like hundreds of little hooks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The burrow grub squalled for a moment more; then it gathered up its body in a tight bundle and <span class="italic">hopped</span> several inches up her arm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She wrenched at her bonds, hoping to dislodge the grub, but it continued to cling to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again it hopped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And again, and now it was on her shoulder, the hooks pinching and digging into her skin like a strip of minute cockleburs. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the burrow grub lift up its eyeless head and point it toward her face, as if testing the air. Its tiny mouth opened, and she saw that it had sharp cutting mandibles behind its upper and lower lips.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Skree-skree</span>? said the burrow grub. <span class="italic">Skree-skra</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not there,” Galbatorix said, and he spoke a word in the ancient language.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On hearing it, the burrow grub swung away from her head, for which she felt a measure of relief. Then it began to worm its way back down her arm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Few things frightened her. The touch of the hot iron frightened her. The thought that Galbatorix might reign forevermore in Urû’baen frightened her. Death, of course, frightened her, although not so much because she feared the end of her existence as because she feared leaving undone all the things she still hoped to accomplish.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">But, for whatever reason, the sight and feel of the burrow grub unnerved her in a way that, until that very moment, nothing else had. Every muscle in her body seemed to burn and tingle, and she felt an overwhelming urge to run, to flee, to put as much distance between herself and the creature as she could, for there seemed to be something profoundly <span class="italic">wrong</span> about the burrow grub. It did not move as it should, and its obscene little mouth reminded her of a child’s, and the sound it made, the horrible, horrible sound, elicited a primal loathing within her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The burrow grub paused by her elbow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Skree-skree!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then its fat, limbless body contracted, and it hopped four, five <span>inches</span> straight up into the air and then dove headfirst toward the inner part of her elbow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As it landed, the burrow grub divided into a dozen small, bright green centipedes, which swarmed over her arm before each chose a spot to sink its mandibles into her flesh and bore its way through her skin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The pain was too great for her to bear; she struggled against her restraints and screamed at the ceiling, but she could not escape her torment, not then and not for a seemingly endless span of time thereafter. The iron had hurt more, but she would have preferred its touch, for the hot metal was impersonal, inanimate, and predictable, all things the burrow grub was not. There was a special horror in knowing that the cause of her pain was a creature <span class="italic">chewing</span> on her, and worse, that it was inside her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the last, she lost her pride and self-control and cried out to the goddess Gokukara for mercy, and then she began to babble as a child might, unable to stop the flow of random words coming from her mouth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And behind her, she heard Galbatorix laughing, and his enjoyment of her suffering made her hate him all the more.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">She blinked, slowly coming back to herself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After several moments, she realized that Murtagh and Galbatorix were gone. She had no recollection of their departure; she must have lost consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The pain was less than before, but she still hurt terribly. She glanced down her body, then averted her eyes, feeling her pulse quicken. Where the centipedes had been—she was not sure whether individually they were still considered burrow grubs—her flesh was swollen and lines of purple blood filled the tracks they had left underneath the surface of her skin, and every track burned. It felt as if she had been lashed across the front of her body with a metal whip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She wondered if perhaps the burrow grubs were still inside of her, <span>lying</span> dormant while they digested their meal. Or perhaps they were metamorphosing, like maggots into flies, and they would turn into something even worse. Or, and this seemed the most terrible possibility, perhaps they were laying eggs within her, and <span class="italic">more</span> of them would soon hatch and begin to feast on her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She shuddered and cried out with fear and frustration.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The wounds made it difficult for her to remain coherent. Her vision faded in and out, and she found herself weeping, which disgusted her, but she could not stop, no matter how hard she tried. As a distraction, she fell to talking to herself—nonsense mostly—anything to bolster her resolve or focus her mind on other subjects. It helped, if only a little.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She knew that Galbatorix did not want to kill her, but she feared that in his anger he had gone further than he intended. She was shaking, and her entire body felt inflamed, as if she had been stung by hundreds of bees. Willpower could sustain her for only so long; no matter how determined she was, there was a limit to what her frame could withstand, and she felt that she was well past that point. Something deep inside her seemed to have broken, and she was no longer confident that she could recover from her injuries.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">The door to the chamber scraped open.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She forced her eyes to focus as she strained to see who was approaching.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was Murtagh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He looked down at her, his lips pinched, his nostrils flared, and a furrow between his brows. At first she thought he was angry, but then she realized he was actually worried and afraid, deathly so. The strength of his concern surprised her; she knew he regarded her with a certain liking—why else would he have convinced Galbatorix to keep her alive?—but she had not suspected that he cared for her quite so much.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She tried to reassure him with a smile. It must not have come out <span>right</span>, for as she did, Murtagh clenched his jaw, as if he was struggling to contain himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Try not to move,” he said, and lifted his hands over her and began to murmur in the ancient language.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">As if I could</span>, she thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His magic soon took effect, and wound by wound, her pain abated, but it did not disappear entirely.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She frowned at him, puzzled, and he said, “I’m sorry. I can do no more. Galbatorix would know how, but it’s beyond me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What … what about your Eldunarí?” she asked. “Surely they can help.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He shook his head. “Young dragons all, or they were when their bodies died. They knew little of magic then, and Galbatorix has taught them almost nothing since. … I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Are those <span class="italic">things</span> still in me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No! No, they’re not. Galbatorix removed them once you passed out.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her relief was profound. “Your spell didn’t stop the pain.” She tried not to sound accusatory, but she could not prevent a note of anger from creeping into her voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He grimaced. “I’m not sure why. It ought to have. Whatever that creature is, it doesn’t fit into the normal pattern of the world.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you know where it’s from?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No. I only learned of it today, when Galbatorix fetched it from his inner chambers.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She closed her eyes for a moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Let me up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Are you s—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Let me up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without a word, he undid her restraints. Then she got to her feet and stood swaying next to the slab while she waited for an attack of light-headedness to recede.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Here,” said Murtagh, handing her his cape. She wrapped it <span>around</span> her body, covering herself for both modesty and warmth, and also so that she did not have to look at the burns, scabs, blisters, and blood-filled lines that disfigured her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Limping—for, among other places, the burrow grub had visited the soles of her feet—she walked to the edge of the chamber. She leaned against the wall and slowly lowered herself to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh joined her, and the two of them sat staring at the opposite wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Despite herself, she began to cry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a while, she felt him touch her shoulder, and she jerked away. She could not help it. He had hurt her more in the past few days than anyone else ever had, and though she knew he had not wanted to do it, she could not forget that it was he who had wielded the hot iron.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even so, when she saw how her reaction stung him, she relented and reached out and took his hand. He gave her fingers a gentle squeeze, then put his arm around her shoulders and drew her close. She resisted for a moment, then relaxed into his embrace and laid her head on his chest as she continued to cry, her quiet sobs echoing in the bare stone room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Some minutes later, she felt him move beneath her as he said, “I’ll find a way to free you, I swear. It’s too late for Thorn and me. But not for you. As long as you don’t pledge fealty to Galbatorix, there’s still a chance I can spirit you out of Urû’baen.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She looked up at him and decided he meant what he said. “How?” she whispered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I haven’t the slightest idea,” he admitted with a roguish smile. “But I will. Whatever it takes. You have to promise me, though, that you won’t give up—not until I’ve tried. Agreed?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t think I can endure that … <span class="italic">thing</span> again. If he puts it on me again, I’ll give him whatever he wants.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You won’t have to; he doesn’t intend to use the burrow grubs again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“… What does he intend?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh was silent for a minute more. “He’s decided to start manipulating what you see, hear, feel, and taste. If that doesn’t work, then he’ll attack your mind directly. You won’t be able to resist him if he does. No one ever has. Before it comes to that, though, I’m sure I’ll be able to rescue you. All you have to do is keep fighting for another few days. That’s it—just another few days.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How can I if I can’t trust my senses?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There is one sense he cannot feign.” Murtagh twisted to look at her more directly. “Will you let me touch your mind? I won’t try to read your thoughts. I only want you to know what my mind feels like, so you can recognize it—so you can recognize <span class="italic">me</span>—in the future.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She hesitated. She knew that this was a turning point. Either she would agree to trust him, or she would refuse and perhaps lose her only chance to avoid becoming Galbatorix’s slave. Still, she remained wary of granting anyone access to her mind. Murtagh could be trying to lull her into lowering her defenses so that he could more easily install himself in her consciousness. Or it might be that he hoped to glean some piece of information by eavesdropping on her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then she thought: <span class="italic">Why should Galbatorix resort to such tricks? He could do either of those things himself. Murtagh is right; I wouldn’t be able to resist him. … If I accept Murtagh’s offer, it may mean my doom, but if I refuse, my doom is inevitable. One way or another, Galbatorix will break me. It’s only a matter of time</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do as you will,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh nodded and half closed his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the silence of her mind, she began to recite the scrap of verse she used whenever she wanted to hide her thoughts or defend her consciousness from an intruder. She concentrated on it with all her might, determined to repel Murtagh if need be and also determined not to think about any of the secrets it was her duty to keep hidden.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">In El-harím, there lived a man, a man with yellow eyes</span>.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">To me, he said, “Beware the whispers, for they whisper lies</span>.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Do not wrestle with the demons of the dark</span>,</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Else upon your mind they’ll place a mark;</span></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Do not listen to the shadows of the deep</span>,</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Else they haunt you even when you sleep</span>.”</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Murtagh’s consciousness pressed against hers, she stiffened and began to recite the lines of the verse even faster. To her surprise, his mind felt familiar. The similarities between his consciousness and—No, she could not say whose, but the similarities were striking, as were the equally prominent differences. Foremost among the differences was his anger, which lay at the center of his being like a cold black heart, clenched and unmoving, with veins of hatred snaking out to entangle the rest of his mind. But his concern for her outshone his anger. Seeing it convinced her that his solicitude was genuine, for to dissemble with one’s inner self was incredibly difficult, and she did not believe that Murtagh could have deceived her so convincingly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">True to his word, he made no attempt to force himself deeper into her mind, and after a few seconds, he withdrew and she again found herself alone with her thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh’s eyes opened fully, and he said, “There now. Will you be able to recognize me if I reach out to you again?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Good. Galbatorix can do many things, but even he cannot imitate the feeling of another person’s mind. I’ll try to warn you before he starts to alter your senses, and I’ll contact you when he stops. That way, he won’t be able to confuse you as to what is real and what is not.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Thank you,” she said, unable to express the full extent of her gratitude in so short a phrase.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Fortunately, we have some time. The Varden are only three days hence, and the elves are fast approaching from the north. Galbatorix has gone to oversee the final placement of Urû’baen’s defenses and <span>to</span> discuss strategy with Lord Barst, who has command of the army now that it’s garrisoned here in the city.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She frowned. That boded ill. She had heard of Lord Barst; he had a fearsome reputation among the nobles of Galbatorix’s court. He was said to be both keen-minded and bloody-handed, and those who were foolish enough to oppose him, he crushed without mercy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not you?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Galbatorix has other plans for me, although he’s yet to share them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How long will he be busy with his preparations?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The rest of today and all of tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you think you can free me before he returns?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t know. Probably not.” A pause fell between them. Then he said, “Now I have a question for you: why did you kill those men? You knew you wouldn’t make it out of the citadel. Was it just to spite Galbatorix, as he said?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She sighed and pushed herself off Murtagh’s chest so she was sitting upright. With some reluctance, he released his hold around her shoulders. She sniffed, then looked him square in the eyes. “I couldn’t just lie there and let him do whatever he wanted to me. I had to fight back; I had to show him that he hadn’t broken me, and I wanted to hurt him however I could.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“So it <span class="italic">was</span> spite!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“In part. What of it?” She expected him to express disgust or condemnation at her actions, but instead he gave her an appraising look and his lips curved in a small, knowing smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then I say well done,” he replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a moment, she returned his smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Besides,” she said, “there was always a chance I <span class="italic">might</span> escape.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He snorted. “And dragons might start eating grass.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Even so, I had to try.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I understand. If I could have, I would have done the same when the Twins first brought me here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And now?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I still can’t, and even if I could, what purpose would it serve?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To that, she had no answer. Silence followed, and then she said, “Murtagh, if it’s not possible to free me from here, then I want your promise that you’ll help me escape by … other means. I wouldn’t ask … I wouldn’t place this burden upon you, but your assistance would make the task easier, and I may not have the opportunity to do it myself.” His lips grew thin and hard as she spoke, but he did not interrupt. “Whatever happens, I won’t allow myself to become a plaything for Galbatorix to order about as he will. I’ll do anything, anything at all to avoid that fate. Can you understand that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His chin dipped in a short nod.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then do I have your word?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He looked down and clenched his fists, his breathing ragged. “You do.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh was taciturn, but eventually she succeeded in drawing him out again, and they passed the time talking about matters of little import. Murtagh told her of the alterations he had made to the saddle Galbatorix had given him for Thorn—changes that Murtagh was justifiably proud of, as they allowed him to mount and dismount faster, as well as to draw his sword with less inconvenience. She told him about the market streets in Aberon, the capital of Surda, and how, as a child, she had often run away from her nurse to explore them. Her favorite of the merchants had been a man of the wandering tribes. His name was Hadamanara-no Dachu Taganna, but he had insisted that she call him by his familiar name, which was Taganna. He sold knives and daggers, and he always seemed to delight in showing her his wares, even though she never bought any.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As she and Murtagh continued to talk, their conversation grew easier and more relaxed. Despite their unpleasant circumstances, she found that she enjoyed speaking with him. He was smart and well educated, and he had a mordant wit that she appreciated, especially given her current predicament.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh seemed to enjoy their conversation as much as she did. Still, the time came when they both recognized that it would be foolish to keep talking, for fear of being caught. So she returned to the slab, where she lay down and allowed him to strap her to the unforgiving block of stone once again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he was about to leave, she said, “Murtagh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He paused and turned to regard her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She hesitated for a moment, then mustered her courage and said, “Why?” She thought he understood her meaning: Why her? Why save her, and now why try to rescue her? She had guessed at the answer, but she wanted to hear him say it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He stared at her for the longest while, and then, in a low, hard voice, he said, “You know why.”</span></p>
