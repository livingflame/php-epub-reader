<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON LIFTED HIS</span></span> head, took a deep breath, and felt a portion of his worries recede.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Riding a dragon was far from restful, but being so close to Saphira was calming for both him and her. The simple pleasure of physical contact comforted them in a way few things did. Also, the constant sound and motion of her flight helped distract him from the black thoughts that had been dogging him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Despite the urgency of their trip and the precarious nature of their circumstances in general, Eragon was glad to be away from the Varden. The recent bloodshed had left him feeling as if he was no longer quite himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Ever since he had rejoined the Varden at Feinster, he had spent the bulk of his time fighting or waiting to fight, and the strain was beginning to wear on him, especially after the violence and horror of Dras-Leona. On the Varden’s behalf, he had killed hundreds of soldiers—few of whom had stood even the slightest chance of harming him—and though his actions had been justified, the memories troubled him. He did not want every fight to be desperate and every opponent to be his equal or his better—far from it—but at the same time, the easy slaughter of so many made him feel more like a butcher than a warrior. Death, he had come to believe, was a corrosive thing, and the more he was around it, the more it gnawed away at who he was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">However, being alone with Saphira—and Glaedr, although the golden dragon had kept to himself since their departure—helped Eragon regain a sense of normalcy. He felt most comfortable alone or in small groups, and he preferred not to spend time in a town <span>or</span> a city or even a camp like the Varden’s. Unlike the majority of people, he did not hate or fear the wilderness; as harsh as the empty lands were, they possessed a grace and a beauty that no artifice could compete with and that he found restorative.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So he let Saphira’s flying distract him, and for the better part of the day, he did nothing more important than watch the landscape slide past.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From the Varden’s camp by the banks of Leona Lake, Saphira set out across the broad expanse of water, angling northwest and climbing so high that Eragon had to use a spell to shield himself from the cold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The lake appeared patchy: shining and sparkling in areas where the angle of the waves reflected the sunlight toward Saphira, dull and gray where it did not. Eragon never tired of staring at the constantly changing patterns of light; nothing else in the world was quite like it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Fisher hawks, cranes, geese, ducks, starlings, and other birds often flew by underneath them. Most ignored Saphira, but a few of the hawks spiraled upward and accompanied her for a short while, seeming more curious than frightened. Two were even so bold as to swerve in front of her, mere feet from her long, sharp teeth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In many ways, the fierce, hook-clawed, yellow-beaked raptors reminded Eragon of Saphira herself, an observation that pleased her, for she admired the hawks as well, though not so much for their appearance as for their hunting prowess.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The shore behind them gradually faded to a hazy purple line, then vanished altogether. For over half an hour, they saw only birds and clouds in the sky and the vast sheet of wind-hammered water that covered the surface of the earth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then, ahead and to their left, the jagged gray outline of the Spine began to appear along the horizon, a welcome sight to Eragon. Although these were not the mountains of his childhood, they still belonged to the same range, and seeing them, he felt not quite so far from his old home.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The mountains grew in size until the stony, snowcapped peaks loomed before them like the broken battlements of a castle wall. Down their dark, green-covered flanks, dozens of white streams tumbled, wending their way through the creases in the land until they joined with the great lake that lay pressed against their foothills. A half-dozen villages sat upon the shore or close thereby, but on account of Eragon’s magic, the people below remained oblivious to Saphira’s presence as she sailed overhead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he looked at the villages, it struck Eragon just how small and isolated they were and, in hindsight, how small and isolated Carvahall had been as well. Compared to the great cities he had visited, the villages were little more than clusters of hovels, barely fit for even the meanest of paupers. Many of the men and women within them, he knew, had never traveled more than a few miles from their birthplace and would live their whole lives in a world bound by the limits of their sight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What a blinkered existence</span>, he thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And yet, he wondered if it was perhaps better to remain in one place and learn all you could about it rather than to constantly roam across the land. Was a broad but shallow education superior to one that was narrow but deep?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He was not sure. He remembered Oromis once telling him that the whole of the world could be deduced from the smallest grain of sand, if one studied it closely enough.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The Spine was only a fraction of the height of the Beor Mountains, yet the slab-sided peaks still towered a thousand feet or more above Saphira as she threaded her way between them, following the shadow-filled gorges and valleys that split the range. Now and then, she had to soar upward to clear a bare, snowy pass, and when she did and Eragon’s range of view widened, he thought the mountains looked like so many molars erupting from the brown gums of the earth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Saphira glided over a particularly deep valley, he saw at the bottom a glade with a ribbony stream wandering across the field <span>of</span> grass. And along the edges of the glade, he glimpsed what he thought might have been houses—or perhaps tents; it was hard to tell—hidden under the eaves of the heavy-boughed spruce trees that populated the flanks of the neighboring mountains. A single spot of firelight shone through a gap in the branches, like a tiny chip of gold embedded within the layers of black needles, and he thought he spied a lone figure lumbering away from the stream. The figure appeared strangely bulky, and its head seemed too large for its body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I think that was an Urgal</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Where</span>? Saphira asked, and he sensed her curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">In the clearing behind us</span>. He shared the memory with her. <span class="italic">I wish we had the time to go back and find out. I’d like to see how they live</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She snorted. Hot smoke streamed out of her nostrils, then rolled down her neck and over him. <span class="italic">They might not take kindly to a dragon and Rider landing among them without warning</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He coughed and blinked as his eyes watered. <span class="italic">Do you mind</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She did not answer, but the line of smoke trailing from her nostrils ceased, and the air around him soon cleared.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Not long afterward, the shape of the mountains began to look familiar to Eragon, and then a large rift opened up before Saphira and he realized they were flying across the pass that led to Teirm—the same pass he and Brom had twice ridden through on horseback. It was much as he remembered it: the western branch of the Toark River still flowed fast and strong toward the distant sea, the surface of the water streaked with white mare’s tails where boulders interrupted its course. The crude road he and Brom had followed by the side of the river was still a pale, dusty line barely wider than a deer trail. He even thought he recognized a clump of trees where they had stopped to eat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira turned westward and proceeded down the river until the mountains dropped away to lush, rain-soaked fields, whereupon she <span>adjusted</span> her course to a more northerly direction. Eragon did not question her decision; she never seemed to lose her bearing, not even on a starless night or when deep underground in Farthen Dûr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sun was close to the horizon when they flew out of the Spine. As dusk settled over the land, Eragon occupied himself by trying to devise ways to trap, kill, or fool Galbatorix. After a time, Glaedr emerged from his self-imposed isolation and joined him in his efforts. They spent an hour or so discussing various strategies, and then they practiced attacking and defending each other with their minds. Saphira participated in the exercise as well, but with limited success, as flying made it difficult for her to concentrate on anything else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Later, Eragon stared at the cold white stars for a while. Then he asked Glaedr, <span class="italic">Could the Vault of Souls contain Eldunarí that the Riders hid from Galbatorix</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No</span>, said Glaedr without hesitation. <span class="italic">It’s impossible. Oromis and I would have known if Vrael had sanctioned such a plan. And if any Eldunarí had been left on Vroengard, we would have found them when we returned to search the island. It’s not so easy to hide a living creature as you seem to think</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why not</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If a hedgehog rolls into a ball, that doesn’t mean that he becomes invisible, now does it? Minds are no different. You can shield your thoughts from others, but your existence is still apparent to anyone who searches the area</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Surely with a spell you could</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If a spell had tampered with our senses, we would have known, for we had wards to prevent that from happening</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">So, no Eldunarí</span>, Eragon concluded glumly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Unfortunately not</span>.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">They flew on in silence as the waxing three-quarter moon rose above the jagged peaks of the Spine. By its light, the land looked as <span>if</span> it were made out of pewter, and Eragon amused himself by imagining that it was an immense sculpture the dwarves had carved and stored within a cave as large as Alagaësia itself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon could feel the pleasure Glaedr took in their flight. Like Eragon and Saphira, the old dragon seemed to welcome the opportunity to leave behind their concerns on the ground, if even only for a short while, and to soar freely through the sky.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was Saphira who spoke next. Between the slow, heavy flaps of her wings, she said to Glaedr, <span class="italic">Tell us a story, Ebrithil</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What manner of story would you hear</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The tale of how you and Oromis were captured by the Forsworn, and how you then escaped</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At this, Eragon’s interest increased. He had always been curious about the matter himself, but he had never worked up the courage to ask Oromis.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Glaedr was quiet for a span, then said, <span class="italic">When Galbatorix and Morzan returned from the wilds and began their campaign against our order, we did not at first realize the severity of the threat. We were concerned, of course, but no more than if we had discovered that a Shade was stalking the land. Galbatorix was not the first Rider to go mad, although he was the first to have acquired a disciple such as Morzan. That alone should have warned us of the danger we faced, but the truth was only apparent in hindsight</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">At the time, we failed to consider that Galbatorix might have gathered other followers or that he would even attempt such a thing. It seemed absurd that any of our brethren could prove susceptible to Galbatorix’s poisonous whisperings. Morzan was still a novice; his weakness was understandable. But those who were already Riders in full? We never questioned their loyalties. For only when they were tempted did they reveal the extent to which their spite and weaknesses had corrupted them. Some wanted revenge for old hurts; others believed that, by virtue of our power, dragons and Riders deserved to rule over the whole of Alagaësia; and others, I am afraid to say, simply enjoyed the chance to tear down what was and indulge themselves however they wanted</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The old dragon paused, and Eragon sensed ancient hates and sorrows shading his mind. Then Glaedr continued: <span class="italic">Events at that point were … confusing. Little was known, and what reports we received were so larded with rumors and speculation as to be useless. Oromis and I began to suspect that something far worse was afoot than most realized. We tried to convince several of the older dragons and Riders, but they disagreed and dismissed our concerns. Fools they were not, but centuries of peace had clouded their vision, and they were unable to see that the world was shifting around us</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Frustrated with the lack of information, Oromis and I left Ilirea to discover what we could for ourselves. We brought two younger Riders with us, both elves and accomplished warriors, who had recently returned from scouting the northern reaches of the Spine. It was partly at their urging that we ventured forth on our expedition. Their names you might recognize, for they were Kialandí and Formora</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah,” said Eragon, suddenly understanding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes. After a day and a half of traveling, we stopped at Edur Naroch, a watchtower built of old to stand guard over Silverwood Forest. Unbeknownst to us, Kialandí and Formora had visited the tower beforehand and slain the three elven rangers stationed there. Then they had placed a trap upon the stones that ringed the tower, a trap that caught us the moment my claws touched the grass upon the knoll. It was a clever spell; Galbatorix had taught it to them himself. We had no defense against it, for it caused us no harm, only held us and slowed us, like honey poured over our bodies and minds. While we were thus snared, minutes passed as seconds. Kialandí, Formora, and their dragons flitted around us faster than hummingbirds; they appeared as no more than dark blurs at the edges of our vision</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When they were ready, they released us. They had cast dozens of spells—spells to bind us in place, spells to blind us, and spells to prevent Oromis from speaking, so as to make it more difficult for him to cast spells. Again, their magic did not hurt us, and thus we had no defense against it. … The moment we could, we attacked Kialandí, Formora, and their dragons with our minds, and they us, and for hours thereafter, we <span>strove</span> against them. The experience was … not pleasant. They were weaker and less skilled than Oromis and I, but there were two of them for each of us, and they had with them the heart of hearts of a dragon named Agaravel—whose Rider they had slain—and her strength added to their own. As a result, we were hard-pressed to defend ourselves. Their intent, we discovered, was to force us to help Galbatorix and the Forsworn enter Ilirea unnoticed, so that they might catch the Riders by surprise and capture the Eldunarí who were then living in the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How did you escape?” asked Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">In time, it became clear that we would not be able to defeat them. So, Oromis decided to risk using magic in an attempt to free us, even though he knew it would provoke Kialandí and Formora into attacking us with magic in return. It was a desperate ploy, but it was the only choice we had</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">At a certain point, without knowing of Oromis’s plans, I struck back at our attackers, seeking to hurt them. Oromis had been waiting for just such a moment. He had long known the Rider who had instructed Kialandí and Formora in the ways of magic, and he was well familiar with Galbatorix’s twisted reasoning. From that knowledge, he was able to guess at how Kialandí and Formora had worded their spells, and where the flaws in their enchantments were likely to lie</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Oromis had only seconds to act; the moment he began to use magic, Kialandí and Formora realized what he was about, panicked, and began to cast their own spells. It took Oromis three tries to break our bonds. How exactly he did it, I cannot say. I doubt whether he really understood it himself. Most simply, he</span> shifted <span class="italic">us a finger’s-breadth away from where we had been standing</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Like how Arya sent my egg from Du Weldenvarden to the Spine</span>? asked Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, and no</span>, Glaedr replied. <span class="italic">Yes, he transported us from one place to another without moving us through the intervening space. But he did not just shift our position, he also shifted the very substance of our flesh, rearranged it so that we were no longer what we once were. Many of the <span>smallest</span> parts of our bodies can be exchanged for one another without ill effect, and so he did with every muscle, bone, and organ</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon frowned. Such a spell was a feat of the highest order, a wonder of magical dexterity that few in history could have hoped to carry out. Still, as impressed as Eragon was, he could not help but ask, “How could that have worked, though? You would still be the same person as before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You would, and yet you would not. The difference between who we had been and who we then were was slight, but it was enough to render useless the enchantments Kialandí and Formora had woven about us</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What of the spells they cast once they noticed what Oromis was doing</span>? asked Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">An image came to Eragon of Glaedr ruffling his wings, as if he were tired of sitting in one position for so long. <span class="italic">The first spell, Formora’s, was meant to kill us, but our wards stopped it. The second, which was from Kialandí … that was a different matter. It was a spell Kialandí had learned from Galbatorix, and he from the spirits who possessed Durza. This I know, for I was in contact with Kialandí’s mind even when he wrought his enchantment. It was a clever, fiendish spell, the purpose of which was to prevent Oromis from touching and manipulating the flow of energy around him, and thereby to prevent him from using magic</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Did Kialandí do the same to you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">He would have, but he feared it would either kill me or sever my connection with my heart of hearts and thus create two independent versions of me that they would then have to subdue. Even more than elves, dragons depend on magic for our existence; without it, we would soon die</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon could sense Saphira’s curiosity was aroused. <span class="italic">Has that ever happened? Has the connection between a dragon and the dragon’s Eldunarí ever been severed while the dragon’s body was still alive</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It has, but that is a tale for another time</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira subsided, but Eragon could tell that she intended to raise the question again at the soonest opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But Kialandí’s spell didn’t stop Oromis from being able to use magic, did it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Not entirely. It was supposed to, but Kialandí cast the spell even as Oromis shifted us from place to place, and so its effect was somewhat lessened. Still, it kept him from working all but the smallest of magics, and as you know, the spell remained with him for the rest of his life, despite the efforts of our wisest healers</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why didn’t his wards protect him?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Glaedr seemed to sigh. <span class="italic">That is a mystery. No one had done such a thing before, Eragon, and of those still living, only Galbatorix now knows the secret of it. The spell was bound to Oromis’s mind, but it may not have affected him directly. Instead, it may have worked upon the energy around him or upon his link to the same. The elves have long studied magic, but even they do not fully understand how the material and immaterial worlds interact. It is a riddle that will likely never be solved. However, it seems reasonable to assume that the spirits know more than we about both the material and the immaterial, considering that they are the embodiment of the second and that they occupy the first when in the form of a Shade</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Whatever the truth may be, the outcome was this: Oromis cast his spell, and he freed us, but the effort was too much for him, and a fit came over him, the first of many. Never again was he able to cast such a powerful spell, and ever after, he suffered a weakness of the flesh that would have killed him if not for his skill with magic. The weakness was already in him when Kialandí and Formora captured us, but when he</span> shifted <span class="italic">us and reshuffled the parts of our bodies, he brought it to the fore. Otherwise, the malady might have lain dormant for many more years</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Oromis fell to the ground, as helpless as a hatchling, even as Formora and her dragon, an ugly brown thing, ran at us, the others close behind. I leaped over Oromis, and I attacked. If they had realized he was crippled, they would have taken advantage of his condition to slip into his mind and make it their own. I had to distract them until Oromis recovered. … I have never fought harder than I did that day. There were four of them <span>arrayed</span> against me, five if you include Agaravel in the tally. Both of my kin, the brown and Kialandí’s purple, were smaller than me, but their teeth were sharp and their claws were fast. Still, my rage gave me a strength greater than normal, and I dealt grave wounds to them both. Kialandí was foolish enough to come within my reach, and I grasped him with my talons and threw him at his own dragon</span>. Glaedr made a sound of amusement. <span class="italic">His magic did not protect him against that. One of the spikes on the purple’s back impaled him, and I might have killed him then and there had not the brown forced me to retreat</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We must have fought for almost five minutes before I heard Oromis shout that we must flee. I kicked up dirt in the faces of my enemies, then returned to Oromis and grasped him in my right forepaw and took flight from Edur Naroch. Kialandí and his dragon could not follow, but Formora and the brown could and did</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">They caught us less than a mile from the watchtower. We closed several times, and then the brown flew underneath me, and I saw Formora about to strike at my right leg with her sword. She was trying to force me to drop Oromis, I think, or perhaps she wanted to kill him. I twisted to evade the blow, and instead of my right leg, her sword struck my left, cutting it off</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The memory that passed through Glaedr’s mind was that of a hard, cold, pinching sensation, as if Formora’s blade had been forged of ice, not steel. The feeling made Eragon queasy. He swallowed and tightened his grip on the front of the saddle, grateful that Saphira was safe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It hurt less than you might imagine, but I knew that I could not continue to fight, so I turned and raced toward Ilirea as fast as my wings could carry me. In a way, Formora’s victory worked against her, for without the burden of my leg, I was able to outdistance the brown and thus escape</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Oromis was able to stop the bleeding, but no more, and he was too weak to contact Vrael or the other elder Riders and warn them of Galbatorix’s plans. Once Kialandí and Formora reported to him, we <span>knew</span> that Galbatorix would attack Ilirea soon thereafter. If he waited, it would only give us time to fortify, and strong as he was, surprise was still Galbatorix’s greatest weapon in those days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">When we arrived at Ilirea, we were dismayed to find that few of our order were still there; in our absence, more had left to search for Galbatorix or to consult with Vrael in person on Vroengard. We convinced those who remained of the danger, and we had them warn Vrael and the other elder dragons and Riders. They were loath to believe that Galbatorix had the forces needed to attack Ilirea—or that he would dare do such a thing—but in the end, we were able to make them see the truth of the matter. As a result, they decided that all of the Eldunarí in Alagaësia should be taken to Vroengard for safekeeping</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It seemed a prudent measure, but we should have sent them to Ellesméra instead. If nothing else, we should have left the Eldunarí that were already in Du Weldenvarden where they were. At least then some of them would have remained free of Galbatorix. Alas, none of us thought that they would be safer among the elves than on Vroengard, at the very center of our order</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Vrael ordered every dragon and Rider who was within a few days journey of Ilirea to hurry to the aid of the city, but Oromis and I feared they would be too late. Nor were we in any state to help defend Ilirea. So we gathered what supplies we needed, and with our two remaining students—Brom and the dragon who is your namesake, Saphira—we left the city that very night. You have seen, I think, the fairth Oromis made as we departed</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded absently as he remembered the image of the beautiful, tower-filled city clustered about the base of an escarpment and lit by a rising harvest moon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And that is how it came to be that we were not in Ilirea when Galbatorix and the Forsworn attacked a few hours later. And it is also why we were not at Vroengard when the oath-breakers defeated the combined might of all our forces and sacked Doru Araeba. From Ilirea, we went to Du Weldenvarden in the hope that the elven healers might be able to cure Oromis’s ailment and restore his ability to use magic. When they could <span>not</span>, we decided to remain where we were, for it seemed safer than flying all the way to Vroengard when both of us were hampered by our injuries and we might be ambushed at any point along the journey.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Brom and Saphira did not stay with us, though. Despite our advice to the contrary, they went to join the fight, and it was in that fighting that your namesake died, Saphira. … And now you know how the Forsworn captured us and how we escaped</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a moment, Saphira said, <span class="italic">Thank you for the story, Ebrithil</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You are welcome, Bjartskular, but never ask it of me again</span>.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">When the moon was nearing its zenith, Eragon saw a nest of dim orange lights floating in the darkness. It took him a moment to realize they were the torches and lanterns of Teirm, many miles away. And, high above the other lights, a bright yellow spot appeared for a second, like a great eye glaring at him; then it vanished and reappeared, flashing on and off in a never-changing cycle, as if the eye were blinking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The lighthouse at Teirm is lit</span>, he said to both Saphira and Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then a storm is brewing</span>, said Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira’s flapping ceased, and Eragon felt her tip forward and begin a long, slow glide toward the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A half hour elapsed before she landed. By then, Teirm was a faint glow to the south, and the beam from the lighthouse was no brighter than a star.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira alit on an empty beach strewn with twisted driftwood. By the light of the moon, the hard, flat strand appeared almost white, while the waves that crashed into it were gray and black and seemed angry, as if the ocean were trying to devour the land with each breaker it sent forth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon unbuckled the straps around his legs, then slid off Saphira, grateful for the opportunity to stretch his muscles. He noted the smell of brine as he sprinted down the strand toward a large chunk of driftwood, his cloak flapping behind him. At the piece of wood, he spun around and sprinted back to Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She sat where he had left her, staring out to sea. He paused, wondering if she was going to speak—for he could feel a great strain within her—but when she remained silent, he turned on his heel and again sprinted to the driftwood. She would talk when she was ready.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Back and forth Eragon ran, until he was warm all over and his legs felt wobbly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And yet the whole time Saphira kept her gaze fixed on some point in the distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Eragon threw himself down on a patch of sedge next to her, Glaedr said, <span class="italic">It would be foolish to try</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon cocked his head, unsure to whom the dragon was speaking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I know I can do it</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You have never before been to Vroengard</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">And if there is a storm, it might drive you far out to sea, or worse. More than one dragon has perished because of overweening confidence. The wind is not your friend, Saphira. It can help you, but it can also destroy you</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I am not a hatchling to be instructed about the wind!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No, but you are still young, and I do not think you are ready for this</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The other way would take too long!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Perhaps, but better to get there safely than not at all</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What are you talking about?” Eragon asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sand under Saphira’s front feet made a gritty, rustling sound as she flexed her claws, sinking them deep into the earth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We have a choice to make</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">From here, Saphira can either fly straight to Vroengard or follow the coastline north until she reaches the point on the mainland closest to the island and then—only then—turn west and cross the sea</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Which path would be faster</span>? Eragon asked, although he had already guessed the answer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Flying straight there</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">But if she does, then she would be over the water the whole time</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira bristled. <span class="italic">It’s no farther than it was from the Varden to here. Or am I wrong</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You’re more tired now, and if there is a storm</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then I’ll fly around it!</span> she said, and huffed, releasing a spike of blue and yellow flame from her nostrils.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The flame branded itself into Eragon’s vision, leaving behind a flashing afterimage. “Ah! Now I can’t see.” He rubbed his eyes as he tried to help the afterimage fade away. <span class="italic">Would flying straight there really be all that dangerous</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It could be</span>, rumbled Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">How much longer would it take to go along the coastline</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Half a day, maybe a bit more</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon scratched the stubble on his chin as he stared at the forbidding mass of water. Then he looked up at Saphira and, in a low voice, said, “Are you sure you can do this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She twisted her neck and returned his gaze with one huge eye. Her pupil had expanded until it was nearly circular; it was so large and black, Eragon felt as if he could crawl into it and disappear altogether.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">As sure as I can be</span>, she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He nodded and ran his hands through his hair as he accustomed himself to the idea. <span class="italic">Then we have to chance it. … Glaedr, if need be, you can guide her? You can help her</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The old dragon was quiet for a while; then he surprised Eragon by humming in his mind, even as Saphira hummed when she was pleased or amused. <span class="italic">Very well. If we are to tempt fate, then let us not be cowards about it. Across the sea it is</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The matter settled, Eragon climbed back onto Saphira, and with a single bound, she left behind the safety of solid land and took flight over the trackless waves.</span></p>
