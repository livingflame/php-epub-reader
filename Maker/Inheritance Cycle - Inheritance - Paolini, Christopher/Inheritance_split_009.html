<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">IN ORDER TO</span></span> catch Roran before he struck the floor, Eragon had to drop Brisingr, which he was reluctant to do. Nevertheless, he opened his hand, and the sword clattered against the stones even as Roran’s weight settled into his arms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Is he badly hurt?” Arya asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon flinched, surprised to find her and Blödhgarm standing next to him. “I don’t think so.” He patted Roran’s cheeks several times, smearing the dust on his skin. In the flat, ice-blue glare of Eragon’s spell, Roran appeared gaunt, his eyes surrounded by bruised shadows, and his lips a purplish color, as if stained with the juice from berries. “Come on, wake up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a few seconds, Roran’s eyelids twitched; then he opened them and looked at Eragon, obviously confused. Relief washed over Eragon, so strong he could taste it. “You blacked out for a moment,” he explained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">He’s alive!</span> Eragon said to Saphira, risking a brief moment of contact.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her pleasure was obvious. <span class="italic">Good. I will stay here and help the elves move the stones away from the building. If you need me, shout, and I’ll find a way to reach you</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran’s mail tinkled as Eragon helped him onto his feet. “What of the others?” Eragon asked, and gestured toward the mound of rubble.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No one could have survived under there. I only escaped because … because I was partially sheltered by the eaves.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And you? You’re all right?” Eragon asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What?” Roran frowned, seeming distracted, as if the thought had not even occurred to him. “I’m fine. … Wrist might be broken. It’s not bad.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon cast a meaningful glance at Blödhgarm. The elf’s features tightened with a faint display of displeasure, but he went over to Roran and, in a smooth voice, said, “If I may. …” He extended a hand toward Roran’s injured arm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">While Blödhgarm labored over Roran, Eragon picked up Brisingr, then stood guard with Arya at the entrance in case any soldiers were so foolhardy as to launch an attack.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There, all done,” Blödhgarm said. He moved away from Roran, who rolled his wrist in a circle, testing the joint.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Satisfied, Roran thanked Blödhgarm, then lowered his hand and cast about the rubble-strewn floor until he found his hammer. He readjusted the position of his armor and looked out the entrance. “I’ve about had my fill of this Lord Bradburn,” he said in a deceptively calm tone. “He has held his seat overlong, I think, and ought to be relieved of his responsibilities. Wouldn’t you agree, Arya?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well then, let’s find the soft-bellied old fool; I would give him a few gentle taps from my hammer in memory of everyone we have lost today.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He was in the main hall a few minutes ago,” Eragon said, “but I doubt he stayed to await our return.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran nodded. “Then we’ll have to hunt him down.” And with that, he strode forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon extinguished his illuminating spell and hurried after his cousin, holding Brisingr at the ready. Arya and Blödhgarm stayed as close beside him as the convoluted passageway would allow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The chamber that the passageway led to was abandoned, as was <span>the</span> main hall of the castle, where the only evidence of the dozens of soldiers and officials who had populated it was a helmet that lay on the floor, rocking back and forth in ever-decreasing arcs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon and Roran ran past the marble dais, Eragon restricting his speed so as not to leave Roran behind. They kicked down a door just to the left of the platform and rushed up the stairs beyond.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At each story, they paused so that Blödhgarm could search with his mind for any trace of Lord Bradburn and his retinue, but he found none.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they reached the third level, Eragon heard a stampede of footsteps and saw a thicket of jabbing spears fill the curved archway in front of Roran. The spears cut Roran on the cheek and on his right thigh, coating his knee with blood. He bellowed like a wounded bear and rammed into the spears with his shield, trying to push his way up the last few steps and out of the stairwell. Men shouted frantically.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind Roran, Eragon switched Brisingr to his left hand, then reached around his cousin, grabbed one of the spears by the haft, and yanked it out of the grip of whoever was holding it. He flipped the spear around and threw it into the center of the men packed in the archway. Someone screamed, and a gap appeared in the wall of bodies. Eragon repeated the process, and his throws soon reduced the number of soldiers enough that, step by step, Roran was able to force the mass of men back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As soon as Roran won clear of the stairs, the twelve remaining soldiers scattered across a wide landing fringed with balustrades, each man seeking room to swing his weapon without obstruction. Roran bellowed again and leaped after the nearest soldier. He parried the man’s sword, then stepped past his guard and struck the man on his helm, which rang like an iron pot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon sprinted across the landing and tackled a pair of soldiers who were standing close together. He knocked them to the ground, then dispatched each of them with a single thrust of Brisingr. An ax hurtled toward him, whirling end over end. He ducked and pushed <span>a</span> man over a balustrade before engaging two others who were trying to disembowel him with billed pikes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Arya and Blödhgarm were moving among the men, silent and deadly, the elves’ inherent grace making the violence appear more like an artfully staged performance than the sordid struggle most fights were.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In a rush of clanging metal, broken bones, and severed limbs, the four of them killed the rest of the soldiers. As always, the combat exhilarated Eragon; it felt to him like being shocked with a bucket of cold water, and it left him with a sense of clarity unequaled by any other activity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran bent over and rested his hands on his knees, gasping for air as if he had just finished a race.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Shall I?” asked Eragon, gesturing at the cuts on Roran’s face and thigh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran tested his weight on the wounded leg a few times. “I can wait. Let’s find Bradburn first.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon took the lead as they filed back into the stairwell and resumed their climb. At last, after another five minutes of searching, they found Lord Bradburn barricaded within the highest room of the keep’s westernmost tower. With a series of spells, Eragon, Arya, and Blödhgarm disassembled the doors and the tower of furniture piled behind them. As they and Roran entered the chambers, the high-ranking retainers and castle guards who had gathered in front of Lord Bradburn blanched, and many began to shake. To Eragon’s relief, he only had to kill three of the guards before the rest of the group placed their weapons and shields on the floor in surrender.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Arya marched over to Lord Bradburn, who had remained silent throughout, and said, “Now, will you order your forces to stand down? Only a few remain, but you can still save their lives.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would not even if I could,” said Bradburn in a voice of such hate and sneering derision, Eragon almost struck him. “You’ll have no concessions from me, elf. I’ll not give up my men to filthy, unnatural creatures such as you. Death would be preferable. And do <span>not</span> think you can beguile me with honeyed words. I know of your alliance with the Urgals, and I would sooner trust a snake than a person who breaks bread with those monsters.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya nodded and placed her hand over Bradburn’s face. She closed her eyes, and for a time, both she and Bradburn were motionless. Eragon reached out with his mind, and he felt the battle of wills that was raging between them as Arya worked her way past Bradburn’s defenses and into his consciousness. It took a minute, but at last she gained control of the man’s mind, whereupon she set about calling up and examining his memories until she discovered the nature of his wards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then she spoke in the ancient language and cast a complex spell designed to circumvent those wards and to put Bradburn to sleep. When she finished, Bradburn’s eyes closed and, with a sigh, he collapsed into her arms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“She killed him!” shouted one of the guards, and cries of fear and outrage spread among the men.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Eragon attempted to convince them otherwise, he heard one of the Varden’s trumpets being winded far off in the distance. Soon another trumpet sounded, this one much closer, then another, and then he caught snatches of what he would have sworn were faint, scattered cheers rising from the courtyard below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Puzzled, he exchanged glances with Arya; then they turned in a circle, looking out each of the windows set within the walls of the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To the west and south lay Belatona. It was a large, prosperous city, one of the largest in the Empire. Close to the castle, the buildings were imposing structures made of stone, with pitched roofs and oriel windows, while farther away they were constructed of wood and plaster. Several of the half-timbered buildings had caught fire during the fighting. The smoke filled the air with a layer of brown haze that stung eyes and throats.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To the southwest, a mile beyond the city, was the Varden’s camp: long rows of gray woolen tents ringed by stake-lined trenches, <span>a</span> few brightly colored pavilions sporting flags and pennants, and stretched out on the bare ground, hundreds of wounded men. The healers’ tents were already filled to capacity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To the north, past the docks and warehouses, was Leona Lake, a vast expanse of water dotted with the occasional whitecap.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Above, the wall of black clouds that was advancing from the west loomed high over the city, threatening to envelop it within the folds of rain that fell skirtlike from its underside. Blue light flickered here and there in the depths of the storm, and thunder rumbled like an angry beast.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">But nowhere did Eragon see an explanation for the commotion that had attracted his attention.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and Arya hurried over to the window directly above the courtyard. Saphira and the men and elves working with her had just finished clearing away the stones in front of the keep. Eragon whistled, and when Saphira looked up, he waved. Her long jaws parted in a toothy grin, and she blew a streamer of smoke toward him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ho! What news?” Eragon shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">One of the Varden standing on the castle walls raised an arm and pointed eastward. “Shadeslayer! Look! The werecats are coming! The werecats are coming!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A cold tingle crawled down Eragon’s spine. He followed the line of the man’s arm eastward, and this time he saw a host of small, shadowy figures emerging from a fold in the land several miles away, on the other side of the Jiet River. Some of the figures went on four legs and some on two, but they were too far away for him to be sure if they were werecats.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Could it be?” asked Arya, sounding amazed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t know. … Whatever they are, we’ll find out soon enough.”</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_17"></div></body>
