<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON NOTICED SEVERAL</span></span> things at once.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">First, that they were standing at one side of a circular chamber over two hundred feet across with a large pit in the center, from which radiated a dull orange glow. Second, that the air was stiflingly hot. Third, that around the outer part of the room were two concentric rings of benchlike tiers—the back one higher than the front—upon which rested numerous dark objects. Fourth, that the wall behind this tier sparkled in numerous places, as if decorated with colored crystal. But he had no opportunity to examine either the wall or the dark objects, for in the open area next to the glowing pit there stood a man with the head of a dragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The man was made of metal, and he gleamed like polished steel. He wore no clothes other than a segmented loincloth fashioned out of the same lustrous material as his body, and his chest and limbs rippled with muscles like those of a Kull. In his left hand, he held a metal shield, and in his right, an iridescent sword that Eragon recognized as the blade of a Rider.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind the man, set within the far side of the room, Eragon vaguely saw a throne with the outline of the creature’s body worn into its back and seat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The dragon-headed man strode forward. His skin and joints moved as smoothly as flesh, but every step sounded as if a great weight was being dropped onto the floor. He stopped thirty feet from Eragon and Saphira and stared at them with eyes that flickered like a pair of crimson flames. Then, lifting his scaled head, he uttered a peculiar metallic roar that echoed until it seemed as if a dozen creatures were bellowing at them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even as Eragon was wondering whether they were supposed to fight the creature, he felt a strange, vast mind touch his. The consciousness was unlike any he had encountered before, and it seemed to contain a host of shouting voices, a great, disjointed chorus that reminded him of the wind inside a storm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before he could react, the mind stabbed through his defenses and seized control of his thoughts. For all the time he had spent practicing with Glaedr, Arya, and Saphira, he could not stop the attack; he could not even slow it. He might as well have tried to hold back the tide with his bare hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A blur of light and a roar of incoherent noise surrounded him as the yammering chorus forced itself into every nook and cranny of his being. Then it felt as if the invader tore his mind into a half-dozen pieces—each of which remained aware of the others, but none of which was free to do as it wished—and his vision fragmented, as if he were seeing the chamber through the facets of a jewel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Six different memories began to race through his fractured consciousness. He had not chosen to recall them; they simply appeared, and they flew past faster than he could follow. At the same time, his body bent and flexed in various poses, and then his arm lifted Brisingr to where his eyes could see, and he beheld six identical versions of the sword. The invader even had him cast a spell, the purpose of which he did not and could not understand, for the only thoughts he had were those the other allowed. Nor did he feel any emotion but that of fading alarm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For what seemed like hours, the alien mind examined every one of his memories, from the moment he had set out from his family’s farm to hunt deer in the Spine—three days before he had found Saphira’s egg—up until the present. In the back of his mind, Eragon could sense the same thing happening to Saphira, but the knowledge meant nothing to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last, long after he would have given up hope of release if he still had command of his thoughts, the whirling chorus carefully rejoined the pieces of his mind and then withdrew.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon staggered forward and dropped to one knee before he was able to regain his balance. Beside him, Saphira lurched and snapped at the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">How</span>? he thought. <span class="italic">Who</span>? To capture both of them at once, and Glaedr as well, he assumed, was something he did not believe even Galbatorix was capable of.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again the consciousness pressed against Eragon’s mind, but this time it did not attack. This time it said, <span class="italic">Our apologies, Saphira. Our apologies, Eragon, but we had to be certain of your intentions. Welcome to the Vault of Souls. Long have we waited for you. And welcome to you as well, cousin. We are glad that you are still alive. Take now your memories, and know that your task is at long last complete!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A bolt of energy flashed between Glaedr and the consciousness. An instant later, Glaedr uttered a mental bellow that made Eragon’s temples throb with pain. A surge of jumbled emotions rushed forth from the golden dragon: sorrow, triumph, disbelief, regret, and, overriding them all, a sense of joyous relief so intense, Eragon found himself smiling without knowing why. And brushing against Glaedr’s mind, he felt not just one strange mind but a multitude, all whispering and murmuring.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Who?” whispered Eragon. Before them, the man with the head of a dragon had not shifted so much as an inch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Eragon</span>, said Saphira. <span class="italic">Look at the wall. Look</span> …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He looked. And he saw that the circular wall was not decorated with crystal, as he had first taken it to be. Rather, dozens upon dozens of alcoves dotted the wall, and within each alcove rested a glittering orb. Some were large, some were small, but they all pulsed with a soft inner glow, like coals smoldering in a dying campfire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s heart skipped a beat as comprehension dawned upon him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He lowered his gaze to the dark objects on the tiers below; they were smooth and ovoid and appeared to have been sculpted from stone of differing colors. As with the orbs, some were large and some were small, but regardless of their size, their shape was one he would have recognized anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A hot flush crept over him, and his knees grew weak. <span class="italic">It cannot be</span>. He wanted to believe what he saw, but he feared that it might be an illusion created to prey on his hopes. And yet the possibility that what he beheld was actually there took his breath away and left him staggered and overwhelmed to such a degree that he knew not what to do or say. Saphira’s reaction was much the same, if not stronger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the mind spoke again: <span class="italic">You are not mistaken, hatchlings, nor do your eyes deceive you. We are the secret hope of our race. Here lie our hearts of hearts—the last free Eldunarí in the land—and here lie the eggs that we have guarded for over a century</span>.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_123"></div></body>
