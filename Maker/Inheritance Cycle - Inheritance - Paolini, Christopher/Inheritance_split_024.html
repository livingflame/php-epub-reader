<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">“<span><span class="calibre27">SIR, SIR! THE</span></span> gate’s opening!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran looked up from the map he was studying as one of the camp sentinels burst into the tent, red-faced and panting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Which gate?” Roran asked, a deadly calm settling over him. “Be precise.” He put aside the rod he had been using to measure distances.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The one closest to us, sir … on the road, not the canal.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Pulling his hammer out from under his belt, Roran left the tent and ran through the camp to its southern edge. There he trained his gaze on Aroughs. To his dismay, he saw several hundred horsemen pouring out of the city, their brightly colored pennants snapping in the wind as they assembled in a broad formation before the black maw of the open gateway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">They’ll cut us to pieces</span>, Roran thought, despairing. Only a hundred fifty or so of his men remained in the camp, and many were wounded and unable to fight. All the rest were at the mills he had visited the previous day, or at the slate mine farther down the coast, or along the banks of the westernmost canal, searching for the barges that were needed if his plan was to succeed. None of the warriors could be recalled in time to fend off the horsemen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he sent the men on their missions, Roran had been aware that he was leaving the camp vulnerable to a counterattack. However, he had hoped that the city folk would be too cowed by the recent assaults on their walls to attempt anything so daring—and that the warriors he had kept with him would be sufficient to convince any distant observers that the main body of his force was still stationed among the tents.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The first of those assumptions, it seemed, had most definitely proven to be a mistake. Whether the defenders of Aroughs were aware of his ruse, he was not entirely sure, but he thought it likely, given the rather limited number of horsemen gathering in front of the city. If the soldiers or their commanders had anticipated facing the full strength of Roran’s company, he would have expected them to field twice as many troops. In either event, he still had to figure out a way to stave off their attack and save his men from being slaughtered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Baldor, Carn, and Brigman ran up, weapons in hand. As Carn hastily donned a mail shirt, Baldor said, “What do we do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There’s nothing we <span class="italic">can</span> do,” said Brigman. “You’ve doomed this whole expedition with your foolishness, Stronghammer. We have to flee—now—before those cursed riders are upon us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran spat on the ground. “Retreat? We’ll not retreat. The men can’t escape on foot, and even if they could, I won’t abandon our wounded.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Don’t you understand? We’ve lost here. If we stay, we’ll be killed—or worse, taken prisoner!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Leave it, Brigman! I’m not about to turn tail and run!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why not? So you don’t have to admit you failed? Because you hope to salvage something of your honor in one final, pointless battle? Is that it? Can’t you see that you’ll only be causing the Varden even greater harm?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">By the base of the city, the horsemen raised their swords and spears over their heads and—with a chorus of whoops and shouts that were audible even over the distance—dug their spurs into their steeds and began to thunder across the sloping plain toward the Varden’s encampment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brigman resumed his tirade: “I won’t let you squander our lives merely to assuage your pride. Stay if you must, but—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Quiet!” Roran bellowed. “Keep your muzzle shut, or I’ll shut it for you! Baldor, watch him. If he does anything you don’t like, let him feel the point of your sword.” Brigman swelled with anger, <span>but</span> he held his tongue as Baldor raised his sword and aimed it at Brigman’s breast.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran guessed that he had maybe five minutes to decide upon a course of action. Five minutes in which so much hung in the balance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He tried to imagine how they could kill or maim enough of the horsemen to drive them away, but almost immediately he discounted the possibility. There was nowhere to herd the onrushing cavalry where his men might have the advantage. The land was too flat, too empty, for any such maneuvers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We can’t win if we fight, so—What if we scare them? But how? Fire?</span> Fire might prove as deadly to friend as to foe. Besides, the damp grass would only smolder. <span class="italic">Smoke? No, that’s of no help</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He glanced over at Carn. “Can you conjure up an image of Saphira and have her roar and breathe fire, as if she were really here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The spellcaster’s thin cheeks drained of color. He shook his head, his expression panicky. “Maybe. I don’t know, I’ve never tried before. I’d be creating an image of her from memory. It might not even look like a living creature.” He nodded toward the line of galloping horsemen. “They’d know something was wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran dug his nails into his palm. Four minutes remained, if that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It might be worth a try,” he muttered. “We just need to distract them, confuse them. …” He glanced at the sky, hoping to see a curtain of rain sweeping toward the camp, but alas, a pair of attenuated clouds drifting high above was the only formation visible. <span class="italic">Confusion, uncertainty, doubt … What is it people fear? The unknown, the things they don’t understand, that’s what</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In an instant, Roran thought of a half-dozen schemes to undermine the confidence of their foes, each more outlandish than the last, until he struck upon an idea that was so simple and so daring, it seemed perfect. Besides, unlike the others, it appealed to his ego, for it required the participation of only one other person: Carn.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Order the men to hide in their tents!” he shouted, already <span>beginning</span> to move. “And tell them to keep quiet; I don’t want to hear so much as a peep from them unless we’re attacked!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Going to the nearest tent, which was empty, Roran jammed his hammer back under his belt and grabbed a dirty woolen blanket from one of the piles of bedding on the ground. Then he ran to a cookfire and scooped up a wide, stumplike section of log the warriors had been using as a stool.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With the log under one arm and the blanket thrown over the opposite shoulder, Roran sprinted out of the camp toward a slight mound perhaps a hundred feet in front of the tents. “Someone get me a set of knucklebones and a horn of mead!” he called. “And fetch me the table my maps are on. Now, blast it, now!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind him, he heard a tumult of footsteps and jangling equipment as the men rushed to conceal themselves inside their tents. An eerie silence fell over the camp a few seconds later, save for the noise created by the men collecting the items he had requested.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran did not waste time looking back. At the crest of the mound, he set the log upright on its thicker end and twisted it back and forth several times to ensure that it would not wobble beneath him. When he was satisfied it was stable, he sat on it and looked out over the sloping field toward the charging horsemen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Three minutes or less remained until they would arrive. Through the wood beneath him, he could feel the drumming of the horses’ hooves—the sensation growing stronger every second.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Where are the knucklebones and mead?!” he shouted without taking his eyes off the cavalry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He smoothed his beard with a quick pass of his hand and tugged on the hem of his tunic. Fear made him wish that he were wearing his mail hauberk, but the colder, more cunning part of his mind reasoned that it would cause his enemies even greater apprehension to see him sitting there with no armor, as if he were totally at his ease. The same part of his mind also convinced him to leave his hammer tucked in his belt, so it would appear he felt safe in the presence of the soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sorry,” Carn said breathlessly as he ran up to Roran, along with a man who was carrying the small folding table from Roran’s tent. They placed the table before him and spread the blanket over it, whereupon Carn handed Roran a horn half-full of mead, as well as a leather cup containing the usual five knucklebones.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Go on, get out of here,” he said. Carn turned to leave, but Roran caught him by the arm. “Can you make the air shimmer on either side of me, as it does above a fire on a cold winter’s day?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Carn’s eyes narrowed. “Possibly, but what good—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Just do it if you can. Now go, hide yourself!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the lanky magician sprinted back toward the camp, Roran shook the knucklebones in the cup, then poured them out onto the table and began to play by himself, tossing the bones into the air—first one, then two, then three, and so forth—and catching them on the back of his hand. His father, Garrow, had often amused himself in a like manner while smoking his pipe and sitting in a rickety old chair on the porch of their house during the long summer evenings of Palancar Valley. Sometimes Roran had played with him, and when he did, he usually lost, but mostly Garrow had preferred to compete against himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Though his heart was thumping hard and fast and his palms were slick with sweat, Roran strove to maintain a calm demeanor. If his gambit was to have the slightest chance of success, he had to comport himself with an air of unbreakable confidence, regardless of his actual emotions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He kept his gaze focused on the knucklebones and refused to look up even as the horsemen drew closer and closer. The sound of the galloping animals swelled until he became convinced that they were going to ride right over him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What a strange way to die</span>, he thought, and smiled grimly. Then he thought of Katrina and of their unborn child, and he took comfort in the knowledge that, should he die, his bloodline would continue. It was not immortality such as Eragon possessed, but it was an immortality of a sort, and it would have to suffice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the last moment, when the cavalry was only a few yards away from the table, someone shouted, “Whoa! Whoa there! Rein in your horses. I say, rein in your horses!” And, with a clatter of buckles and creaking leather, the champing line of animals reluctantly slowed to a halt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And still, Roran kept his eyes angled downward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He sipped the pungent mead, then tossed the bones again and caught two of them on the back of his hand, where they lay rocking on the ridges of his tendons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The aroma of freshly overturned soil wafted over him, warm and comforting, along with the distinctly less pleasant smell of lathered horseflesh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ho there, my fine fellow!” said the same man who had ordered the soldiers to halt. “Ho there, I say! Who are you to sit here this splendid morning, drinking and enjoying a merry game of chance, as if you hadn’t a care in the world? Do we not merit the courtesy of being met with drawn swords? Who are you, I say?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Slowly, as if he had just noticed the presence of the soldiers and considered it to be of little importance, Roran raised his gaze from the table to regard a small bearded man with a flamboyantly plumed helm who sat before him on an enormous black war-horse, which was heaving like a pair of bellows.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m nobody’s <span class="italic">fine fellow</span>, and certainly not yours,” Roran said, making no effort to conceal his dislike at being addressed in such a familiar manner. “Who are you, I might ask, to interrupt my game so rudely?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The long, striped feathers mounted atop the man’s helm bobbed and fluttered as he looked Roran over, as if Roran were an unfamiliar creature he had encountered while hunting. “Tharos the Quick is my name, Captain of the Guard. Rude as you are, I must tell you, it would grieve me mightily to kill a man as bold as yourself without knowing his name.” As if to emphasize his words, Tharos lowered the spear he held until it was pointing at Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Three rows of riders were clustered close behind Tharos. Among their numbers, Roran spied a slim, hook-nosed man with the emaciated face and arms—which were bare to the shoulders—that Roran had come to associate with the spellcasters of the Varden. Very suddenly, he found himself hoping that Carn had succeeded in making the air shimmer. However, he dared not turn his head to look.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Stronghammer is my name,” he said. With a single deft movement, he gathered up the knucklebones, tossed them skyward, and caught three on his hand. “Roran Stronghammer, and Eragon Shadeslayer is my cousin. You might have heard mention of him, if not of me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A rustle of unease spread among the line of horsemen, and Roran thought he saw Tharos’s eyes widen for an instant. “An impressive claim, that, but how can we be sure of its veracity? Any man might say he is another if it served his purpose.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran drew his hammer and slammed it down on the table with a muffled <span class="italic">thump</span>. Then, ignoring the soldiers, he resumed his game. He uttered a noise of disgust as two of the bones fell from the back of his hand, costing him the round.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah,” said Tharos, and coughed, clearing his throat. “You have a most illustrious reputation, Stronghammer, although some argue that it has been exaggerated beyond all reason. Is it true, for example, that you single-handedly felled nigh on three hundred men in the village of Deldarad in Surda?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I never learned what the place was called, but if Deldarad it was, then yes, I slew many a soldier there. It was only a hundred ninety-three, however, and I was well guarded by my own men while I fought.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Only a hundred ninety-three?” Tharos said in a wondering tone. “You are too modest, Stronghammer. Such a feat might earn a man a place in many a song and story.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran shrugged and lifted the horn to his mouth, feigning the action of swallowing, for he could not afford to have his mind clouded <span>by</span> the potent dwarf brew. “I fight to win, not to lose. … Let me offer you a drink, as one warrior to another,” he said, and extended the horn toward Tharos.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The short warrior hesitated, and his eyes darted toward the spellcaster behind him for a second. Then he wet his lips and said, “Perhaps I will at that.” Dismounting his charger, Tharos handed his spear to one of the other soldiers, pulled off his gauntlets, and walked over to the table, where he cautiously accepted the horn from Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Tharos sniffed at the mead, then downed a hearty quaff. The feathers on his helm quivered as he grimaced.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s not to your liking?” Roran asked, amused.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I confess, these mountain drinks are too harsh for my tongue,” Tharos said, returning the horn to Roran. “I much prefer the wines of our fields; they are warm and mellow and less likely to strip a man of his senses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“’Tis sweet as mother’s milk to me,” Roran lied. “I drink it morning, noon, and night.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Donning his gloves once again, Tharos returned to the side of his horse, hauled himself into the saddle, and took back his spear from the soldier who had been holding it for him. He directed another glance toward the hook-nosed spellcaster behind him, whose complexion, Roran noticed, had acquired a deathly cast in the brief span since Tharos had set foot on the ground. Tharos must have noticed the change in his magician as well, for his own expression became strained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“My thanks for your hospitality, Roran Stronghammer,” he said, raising his voice so that his entire troop could hear. “Mayhap I will soon have the honor of entertaining you within the walls of Aroughs. If so, I promise to serve you the finest wines from my family’s estate, and perhaps with them I will be able to wean you off such barbaric milk as you have there. I think you will find our wine has much to recommend it. We let it age in oaken casks for months or sometimes even years. It would be a pity if all that work were <span>wasted</span> and the casks were knocked open and the wine were allowed to run out into the streets and paint them red with the blood of our grapes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That would indeed be a shame,” Roran replied, “but sometimes you cannot avoid spilling a bit of wine when cleaning your table.” Holding the horn out to one side, he tipped it over and poured what little mead remained onto the grass below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Tharos was utterly still for a moment—even the feathers on his helm were motionless—then, with an angry snarl, he yanked his horse around and shouted at his men, “Form up! Form up, I say. … Yah!” And with that final yell, he spurred his horse away from Roran, and the rest of the soldiers followed, urging their steeds to a gallop as they retraced their steps to Aroughs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran maintained his pretense of arrogance and indifference until the soldiers were well away, then he slowly released his breath and rested his elbows on his knees. His hands were trembling slightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It worked</span>, he thought, amazed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He heard men running toward him from the camp, and he looked over his shoulder to see Baldor and Carn approaching, accompanied by at least fifty of the warriors who had been hiding within the tents.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You did it!” exclaimed Baldor as they drew near. “You did it! I can’t believe it!” He laughed and slapped Roran on the shoulder hard enough to knock him against the table.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The other men crowded around him, also laughing, as well as praising him with extravagant phrases, boasting that under his leadership they would capture Aroughs without so much as a single casualty, and belittling the courage and character of the city’s inhabitants. Someone shoved a warm, half-full wineskin into his hand, which he stared at with unexpected loathing, then passed to the man directly to his left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Did you cast any spells?” he asked Carn, his words barely audible over the hubbub of the celebrations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What?” Carn leaned closer, and Roran repeated his question, <span>whereupon</span> the magician smiled and nodded vigorously. “Aye. I managed to make the air shimmer as you wanted.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And did you attack their enchanter? When they left, he looked as if he was about to faint.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Carn’s smile broadened. “It was his own doing. He kept trying to break the illusion he thought I had created—to pierce the veil of shimmering air so he could see what lay behind—but there was nothing to break, nothing to pierce, so he expended all his strength in vain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Roran chuckled, and his chuckle grew into a long, full-bodied laugh that rose above the excited clamor and rolled out over the fields in the direction of Aroughs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For several minutes, he allowed himself to bask in the admiration of his men, until he heard a loud warning cry from one of the sentries stationed at the edge of the camp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Move aside! Let me see!” said Roran, and sprang to his feet. The warriors complied, and he beheld a lone man off to the west—whom he recognized as one of the party he had sent to search the banks of the canals—riding hard over the fields, heading toward the camp. “Have him come here,” instructed Roran, and a lanky, red-haired swordsman ran off to intercept the rider.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">While they waited for the man to arrive, Roran picked up the knucklebones and dropped them, one by one, into the leather cup. The bones made a satisfying clatter as they landed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As soon as the warrior was within hailing distance, Roran called out, “Ho there! Is all well? Were you attacked?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To Roran’s annoyance, the man remained silent until he was only a few yards away, whereupon he jumped off his mount and presented himself before Roran, standing as stiff and straight as a sun-starved pine, and, in a loud voice, exclaimed, “Captain, sir!” Upon closer inspection, Roran realized that the man was actually more of a boy—that, in fact, he was the same scraggly youth who had grabbed his reins when he had first ridden into the camp. The realization did nothing to sate Roran’s frustrated curiosity, though.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well, what is it? I haven’t got all day.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sir! Hamund sent me to tell you that we found all the barges we need and that he’s building the sleds to transport them across to the other canal.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran nodded. “Good. Does he need any more help to get them there in time?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sir, no sir!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And is that all?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sir, yes sir!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You don’t have to keep calling me <span class="italic">sir</span>. Once is enough. Understood?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sir, yes—Uh, yes s—Uh, I mean, yes, of course.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran suppressed a smile. “You’ve done well. Get yourself something to eat and then ride out to the mine and report back to me. I want to know what they’ve accomplished so far.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes si—Sorry, sir—That is, I didn’t … I’ll be going at once, Captain.” Two spots of crimson appeared on the youth’s cheeks as he stammered. He ducked his head in a quick bow, then hurried back to his steed and trotted off toward the tents.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The visit left Roran in a more serious mood, for it reminded him that, as fortunate as they were to have won a reprieve from the soldiers’ blades, there was much that still needed doing, and any of the tasks that lay before them might cost them the siege if handled badly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To the warriors at large, he said, “Back to the camp with the lot of you! I want two rows of trenches dug around the tents by nightfall; those yellow-bellied soldiers might change their minds and decide to attack anyway, and I want to be prepared.” A few of the men groaned at the mention of digging trenches, but the rest appeared to accept the order with good humor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In a low voice, Carn said, “You don’t want to tire them out too much before tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know,” Roran replied, also in a soft tone. “But the camp needs fortifying, and it’ll help keep them from brooding. Besides, no <span>matter</span> how worn out they may be tomorrow, battle will give them new strength. It always does.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">The day passed quickly for Roran when he was concentrating on some immediate problem or occupied with intense physical exertion, and slowly whenever his mind was free to ponder their situation. His men worked valiantly—by saving them from the soldiers, he had won their loyalty and devotion in a way that words never could—but it seemed ever more obvious to him that, despite their efforts, they would not be able to finish the preparations in the brief span of hours that remained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">All through the late morning, afternoon, and early evening, a sense of sick hopelessness grew within Roran, and he cursed himself for deciding upon such a complicated and ambitious plan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I should have known from the start that we didn’t have the time for this</span>, he thought. But it was too late to try some other scheme. The only option left was to strive their utmost and hope that, somehow, it would be enough to wrest victory from the mistakes of his incompetence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When dusk arrived, a faint spark of optimism leavened his pessimism, for all of a sudden, the preparations began to come together with unexpected speed. And a few hours later, when it was fully dark and the stars shone bright overhead, he found himself standing by the mills along with almost seven hundred of his men, having completed all of the arrangements needed if they were to capture Aroughs before the end of the following day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran uttered a short laugh of relief, pride, and incredulousness as he gazed upon the object of their toils.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he congratulated the warriors around him and bade them return to their tents. “Rest now, while you can. We attack at dawn!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And the men cheered, despite their evident exhaustion.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_47"></div></body>
