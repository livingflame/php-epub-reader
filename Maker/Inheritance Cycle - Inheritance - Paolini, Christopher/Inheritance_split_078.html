<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">AFTER THEIR VICTORY</span></span> at Urû’baen, the months passed both quickly and slowly for Eragon. Quickly because there was much for him and Saphira to do, and rare was the day that they were not exhausted by sundown. Slowly because he continued to feel a lack of purpose—despite the many tasks Queen Nasuada gave them—and it seemed to him as if they were idling in a patch of becalmed water, waiting for something, anything, to push them back into the main current.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and Saphira stayed in Urû’baen for another four days after Nasuada was chosen queen, helping establish the Varden’s presence there and throughout the surrounding area. Much of that time they spent dealing with the inhabitants of the city—usually placating crowds who were furious with some action of the Varden’s—and hunting groups of soldiers who had fled Urû’baen and were preying upon travelers, peasants, and nearby estates to support themselves. He and Saphira also participated in the effort to rebuild the city’s massive front gate, and at Nasuada’s behest, he cast several spells designed to prevent those still loyal to Galbatorix from working against her. The spells applied only to the people within the city and the adjacent lands, but having them in place made everyone in the Varden feel safer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon noticed that the Varden, the dwarves, and even the elves treated him and Saphira differently than they had before Galbatorix’s death. They were more respectful and deferential, especially the humans, and they regarded him and Saphira with what he slowly came to understand was a sense of awe. He enjoyed it <span>at</span> first—Saphira did not seem to care one way or another—but it began to bother him when he realized that many of the dwarves and humans were so eager to please him, they would tell him whatever they thought he wanted to hear and not the actual truth. The discovery unsettled him; he felt unable to trust anyone other than Roran, Arya, Nasuada, Orik, Horst, and of course, Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He saw little of Arya during those days. The few times they met, she seemed withdrawn, which he recognized was her way of dealing with her grief. They never had a chance to talk in private, and the only condolences he was able to offer were brief and awkward. He thought she appreciated them, but it was hard to tell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As for Nasuada, she seemed to regain much of her former drive, spirit, and energy after a single night’s sleep, which amazed Eragon. His opinion of her increased tremendously upon hearing her account of her ordeal in the Hall of the Soothsayer, as did his regard for Murtagh, of whom Nasuada spoke not a word thereafter. She complimented Eragon on his leadership of the Varden in her absence—although he protested that he had been gone most of that time—and thanked him for rescuing her as quickly as he had, for as she admitted late in their conversation, Galbatorix had nearly succeeded in breaking her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Upon the third day, Nasuada was coronated in a great square near the center of the city, in full view of a vast crowd of humans, dwarves, elves, werecats, and Urgals. The explosion that had ended Galbatorix’s life had destroyed the ancient crown of the Broddrings, so the dwarves had forged a new crown from gold found in the city and from jewels the elves had taken from their helms or from the pommels of their swords.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The ceremony was simple, but all the more effective for it. Nasuada approached on foot from the direction of the ruined citadel. She wore a dress of royal purple—cut short at the elbows so that all might see the scars that lined her forearms—with a train fringed with mink, which Elva carried, for Eragon had heeded Murtagh’s <span>warning</span> and insisted that the girl stay as close to Nasuada as possible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A slow drumbeat sounded as Nasuada walked up to the dais that had been erected in the center of the square. At the top of the dais, next to the carved chair that would serve as her throne, stood Eragon, with Saphira close behind. In front of the raised platform were the kings Orrin, Orik, and Grimrr, along with Arya, Däthedr, and Nar Garzhvog.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada ascended the dais, then knelt before Eragon and Saphira. A dwarf of Orik’s clan presented Eragon with the newly made crown, which he placed upon Nasuada’s head. Then Saphira arched her neck and, with her snout, touched Nasuada upon the brow, and both she and Eragon said:</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“<span class="italic">Rise now as queen, Nasuada, daughter of Ajihad and Nadara</span>.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A fanfare of trumpets rang forth, and the gathered crowd—which had been deathly silent—began to cheer. It was a strange cacophony, what with the bellows of Urgals intermingled with the melodious voices of the elves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Nasuada sat upon the throne. King Orrin came before her and swore his allegiance, followed by Arya, King Orik, Grimrr Halfpaw, and Nar Garzhvog, who each pledged the friendship of their respective races.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The event affected Eragon strongly. He found himself holding back tears as he gazed at Nasuada sitting regnant on her throne. Only with her coronation did it feel as if the specter of Galbatorix’s oppression had begun to recede.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Afterward, they feasted, and the Varden and their allies celebrated throughout the night and into the next day. Eragon remembered little of the festivities, save the dancing of the elves, the pounding of the dwarves’ drums, and the four Kull who climbed a tower along the city wall and there stood blowing horns made from the skulls of their fathers. The people of the city joined in the celebrations as well, and among them, Eragon saw relief and jubilation <span>that</span> Galbatorix was no longer king. And underlying their emotions, and those of everyone present, was an awareness of the importance of the moment, for they knew they were witnessing the end of one age and the beginning of another.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Upon the fifth day, when the gate was nearly rebuilt and the city seemed reasonably secure, Nasuada ordered Eragon and Saphira to fly to Dras-Leona, and thence to Belatona, Feinster, and Aroughs, and in each place to use the name of the ancient language to release from their oaths everyone who had sworn fealty to Galbatorix. She also asked Eragon to bind the soldiers and nobles with spells—even as he had bound the people of Urû’baen—to keep them from trying to undermine the newly established peace. That, Eragon had refused, for he felt it was too similar to how Galbatorix had controlled those who served him. In Urû’baen, the risk of hidden killers or other loyalists was great enough that Eragon had been willing to do as she wished. But not elsewhere. To his relief, Nasuada agreed with him after some consideration.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and Saphira took with them over half the Eldunarí from Vroengard; the rest remained behind with the hearts of hearts that had been rescued from Galbatorix’s treasure room. Blödhgarm and his spellcasters—who were no longer bound to defend Eragon and Saphira—moved those Eldunarí to a castle several miles northeast of Urû’baen, where it would be easy to protect the hearts against any who might seek to steal them, and where the thoughts of the mad dragons would not affect the minds of any but their caretakers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Only once Eragon and Saphira were satisfied that the Eldunarí were safe did they depart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When they arrived at Dras-Leona, Eragon was astounded by the number of spells he found woven throughout the city, as well as in the dark tower of stone, Helgrind. Many of them, he guessed, were hundreds of years old, if not older: forgotten enchantments from ages past. He left those that seemed harmless and removed those that did not, but ofttimes it was difficult to tell, and he was reluctant <span>to</span> tamper with spells whose purpose he did not understand. Here the Eldunarí proved helpful; in several cases, they remembered who had cast a spell and why, or else they were able to divine its purpose from information that meant nothing to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When it came to Helgrind and the various holdings of the priests—who had gone into hiding as soon as news of Galbatorix’s demise had reached them—Eragon did not bother trying to determine which spells were dangerous and which were not; he removed them all. He also used the name of names to search for the belt of Beloth the Wise in the ruins of the great cathedral, but without success.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They stayed in Dras-Leona for three days, then they proceeded to Belatona. There too Eragon removed Galbatorix’s enchantments, as well as at Feinster and Aroughs. In Feinster, someone tried to kill him with a poisoned drink. His wards protected him, but the incident angered Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If I ever corner the rat-coward who did this, I’ll eat him alive from the toes up</span>, she growled.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">On the return trip to Urû’baen, Eragon suggested a slight change of direction. Saphira agreed and altered her course, tilting so the horizon stood on end and the world was divided equally between the dark blue sky and the green and brown earth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took a half day of searching, but at last Saphira found the cluster of sandstone hills and, among them, one hill in particular: a tall, sloping mound of reddish stone with a cave halfway up its side. And upon its crest, a glittering tomb of diamond.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The hill looked exactly as Eragon remembered. When he gazed upon it, he felt his chest grow tight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira landed next to the tomb. Her claws scraped against the pitted stone, chipping off flakes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With slow fingers, Eragon unbuckled his legs. Then he slid to the ground. A wave of dizziness passed through him at the smell of the warm stone, and for a moment, he felt as if he were in the past.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he shook himself, and his mind cleared. He walked to the tomb and looked into its crystal depths, and there he saw Brom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There he saw his father.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brom’s appearance had not changed. The diamond that encased his body protected him from the ravages of time, and his flesh showed no hint of decay. The skin of his lined face was firm, and it had a rosy tint, as if hot blood still coursed beneath the surface. At any moment, it seemed as if Brom might open his eyes and rise to his feet, ready to continue on their unfinished journey. In a way, he had become deathless, for he no longer aged as others did, but would remain forever the same, caught in a dreamless sleep.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brom’s sword lay atop his chest and the long white pennant of his beard, with his hands folded over the hilt, just as Eragon had placed them. By his side was his gnarled staff, carved, Eragon now realized, with dozens of glyphs from the ancient language.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Tears welled in Eragon’s eyes. He fell to his knees and wept quietly for a timeless while. He heard Saphira join him, felt her with his mind, and he knew that she too mourned Brom’s passing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last Eragon got to his feet and leaned against the edge of the tomb as he studied the shape of Brom’s face. Now that he knew what to look for, he could see the similarities between their features, blurred and obscured by age and by Brom’s beard, but still unmistakable. The angle of Brom’s cheekbones, the crease between his eyebrows, the way his upper lip curved; all those Eragon recognized. He had not inherited Brom’s hooked nose, however. His nose he had gotten from his mother.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked down, breathing heavily as his eyes again grew blurry. “It’s done,” he said in an undertone. “I did it. … <span class="italic">We</span> did it. Galbatorix is dead, Nasuada is on the throne, and both Saphira and I are unharmed. That would please you, wouldn’t it, you old fox?” He laughed shortly and wiped his eyes with the back of his wrist. “What’s more, there are dragon eggs in Vroengard. Eggs! The dragons aren’t going to die out. And Saphira and I will be the ones to raise them. You never foresaw <span class="italic">that</span>, now did you?” He laughed again, <span>feeling</span> silly and grief-stricken at the same time. “What would you think of this all, I wonder? You’re the same as ever, but we’re not. Would you even recognize us?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Of course he would</span>, said Saphira. <span class="italic">You are his son</span>. She touched him with her snout. <span class="italic">Besides, your face isn’t so different that he would mistake you for someone else, even if your scent has changed</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It has?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You smell more like an elf now. … Anyway, he would hardly think I was Shruikan or Glaedr, now would he</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon sniffed and pushed himself off the tomb. Brom looked so lifelike within the diamond, the sight of him inspired an idea: a wild, improbable idea that he almost dismissed but that his emotions would not let him ignore. He thought of Umaroth and the Eldunarí—of all their collected knowledge and of what they had accomplished with his spell in Urû’baen—and a spark of desperate hope kindled within his heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Speaking both to Saphira and Umaroth, he said, <span class="italic">Brom had only just died when we buried him. Saphira didn’t turn the stone to diamond until the following day, but he was still encased in stone, away from the air, through the night. Umaroth, with your strength and your knowledge, maybe … maybe we could still heal him</span>. Eragon shivered as if he were in the grip of a fever. <span class="italic">I didn’t know how to mend his wound before, but now—now I think I could</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It would be more difficult than you imagine</span>, said Umaroth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, but you could do it!</span> said Eragon. <span class="italic">I’ve seen you and Saphira accomplish amazing things with magic. Surely this isn’t beyond you!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You know that we cannot use magic on command</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And even if we succeeded</span>, said Umaroth, <span class="italic">there is every chance that we would be unable to restore Brom’s mind to what it was. Minds are complicated things, and he might easily end up with his wits muddled or his personality altered. And then what? Would you want him to live like that? Would</span> he? <span class="italic">No, it is best to let him be, Eragon, and to honor him with your thoughts and actions, as you have. You wish it were otherwise. So <span>do</span> all who have lost one they care about. However, it is the way of things. Brom lives on in your memories, and if he was the man you showed us, he would be content with that. Let you be content with that as well</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">But</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was not Umaroth who interrupted, but the oldest of the Eldunarí, Valdr. He surprised Eragon by speaking not in images or feelings, but in words of the ancient language, strained and labored, as if each was foreign to him. And he said, <span class="italic">Leave the dead to the earth. They are not for us</span>. Then he spoke no more, but Eragon felt from him a great sadness and sympathy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon let out a long sigh and closed his eyes for a moment. Then, in his heart, he allowed himself to release his misguided hope and again accept the fact that Brom was gone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah,” he said to Saphira. “I didn’t think this would be so difficult.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It would be strange if it were not</span>. He felt her warm breath ruffle the hair on the top of his head as she touched his back with the side of her muzzle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He smiled weakly and gathered up his courage to look at Brom again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Father,” he said. The word tasted strange in his mouth; he had never had cause to say it to anyone before. Then Eragon shifted his gaze to the runes he had set into the spire at the head of the tomb, which read:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">H<span><span class="calibre27">ERE</span></span> L<span><span class="calibre27">IES</span></span> B<span><span class="calibre27">ROM</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Who was a Dragon Rider<br class="calibre23"/>And like a father<br class="calibre23"/>To me.<br class="calibre23"/>May his name live on in glory</span>.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He smiled painfully at how close he had come to the truth. Then he spoke in the ancient language, and he watched the diamond <span>shimmer</span> and flow as a new pattern of runes formed upon its surface. When he finished, the inscription had changed to:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">H<span><span class="calibre27">ERE</span></span> L<span><span class="calibre27">IES</span></span> B<span><span class="calibre27">ROM</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Who was</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">A Rider bonded to the dragon Saphira</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Son of Holcomb and Nelda</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Beloved of Selena</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Father of Eragon Shadeslayer</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Founder of the Varden</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And Bane of the Forsworn</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">May his name live on in glory</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre34"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Stydja unin mor’ranr</span>.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was a less personal epitaph, but it seemed more fitting to Eragon. Then he cast several spells to protect the diamond from thieves and vandals.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He continued to stand next to the tomb, reluctant to turn away and feeling as if there ought to be something <span class="italic">more</span>—some event or emotion or realization that would make it easier for him to say farewell to his father and thus to leave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last he put his hand atop the cool diamond, wishing that he could reach through it to touch Brom one final time. And he said, “Thank you for everything you taught me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira snorted and bowed her head until her snout tapped against the hard jewel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon turned and, with a sense of finality, he slowly climbed onto Saphira’s back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He was somber for a time as Saphira took off and flew northeast, toward Urû’baen. When the patch of sandstone hills was no more than a smudge on the horizon, he let out a long breath and looked up into the azure sky.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A smile split his face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What is so amusing</span>? asked Saphira, and she swung her tail back and forth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The scale on your snout is regrowing</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her delight was evident. Then she sniffed and said, <span class="italic">I always knew it would. Why would it not</span>? However, he could feel her sides vibrating against his heels as she hummed with satisfaction, and he patted her and laid his chest against her neck, feeling the warmth from her body seeping into his.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_158"></div></body>
