<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON FROWNED AS</span></span> he stepped out of the tunnel into the early-afternoon sunlight that bathed the clearing before the Rock of Kuthian.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He felt as if he had forgotten something important. He tried to remember what, but nothing came to mind, only a sense of emptiness that unsettled him. Had it to do with … no, he could not recall. <span class="italic">Saphira, did you</span> … he started to say, then trailed off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Nothing. I just thought … Never mind; it doesn’t matter</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind them, the doors to the tunnel swung shut with a hollow boom, and the lines of glyphs upon them faded away, and the rough, mossy spire once again appeared to be a solid piece of stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Come</span>, said Umaroth, <span class="italic">let us be away. The day grows long, and many leagues lie between here and Urû’baen</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon glanced around the clearing, still feeling as if he was missing something; then he nodded and climbed into Saphira’s saddle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he tightened the straps around his legs, the eerie chatter of a shadow bird sounded among the heavy-boughed fir trees to the right. He looked, but the creature was nowhere to be seen. He made a face. He was glad to have visited Vroengard, but he was equally glad to be leaving. The island was an unfriendly place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Shall we</span>? asked Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Let’s</span>, he said with a sense of relief.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a sweep of her wings, Saphira jumped into the air and took flight over the grove of apple trees at the other side of the clearing. She rose quickly above the floor of the bowl-shaped valley, circling <span>the</span> ruins of Doru Araeba as she climbed. Once she was high enough to soar over the mountains, she turned east and set off for the mainland and Urû’baen, leaving behind the remains of the Riders’ once-glorious stronghold.</span></p>
