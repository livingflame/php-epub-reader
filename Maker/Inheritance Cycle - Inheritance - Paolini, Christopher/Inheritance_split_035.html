<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">THE FIRST THING</span></span> Eragon noticed was the difference in the colors.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The stone blocks in the ceiling appeared richer than before. Details that had been obscure now seemed sharp and vivid, while others that had been prominent were subdued. Below him, the sumptuous nature of the patterned disk was even more apparent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took him a moment to understand the reason for the change: Arya’s red werelight no longer illuminated the chamber. Instead, what light there was came from the muted glow of the crystals and the lit candles in the candelabra.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Only then did he realize that something was crammed into his mouth, stretching his jaw painfully wide, and that he was hanging by his wrists from a chain mounted in the ceiling. He tried to move and found that his ankles were shackled and secured to a metal loop in the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he twisted in place, he saw Arya next to him, trussed and suspended in the same manner. Like him, she was gagged with a ball of cloth in her mouth and a rag tied around her head to hold it in place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She was already awake and watching him, and he saw she was relieved at his return to consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why hasn’t she escaped already</span>? he wondered. Then: <span class="italic">What happened</span>? His thoughts felt thick and slow, as if he were drunk with exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He looked down and saw that he had been stripped of his weapons and armor; he was clad only in his leggings. The belt of Beloth the Wise was gone, as was the necklace the dwarves had given him that prevented anyone from scrying him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Looking up, he saw that the elf ring Aren was missing from his hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A touch of panic gripped him. Then he reassured himself with the knowledge that he was not helpless, not so long as he could work magic. Because of the cloth in his mouth, he would have to cast a spell without uttering it aloud, which was somewhat more dangerous than the normal method—for if his thoughts strayed during the process, he might accidentally select the wrong words—but not so dangerous as casting a spell without any use of the ancient language at all, which was perilous indeed. In any event, it would take only a small amount of energy for him to free himself, and he was confident he could do it without too much trouble.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He closed his eyes and gathered his resources in preparation. As he did, he heard Arya rattling her chain and making muffled noises.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Glancing over, he saw her shaking her head at him. He raised his eyebrows in a wordless inquiry: <span class="italic">what is it</span>? But she was unable to do anything more than grunt and continue to shake her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Frustrated, Eragon cautiously pushed out his mind toward her—alert for the slightest hint of intrusion from anyone else—but to his alarm, he felt only a soft, indistinct pressure surrounding him, as if bales of wool were packed around his mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Panic began to well up inside of him again, despite his efforts to control it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He was not drugged. Of that, he was sure. But he did not know what else besides a drug could prevent him from touching Arya’s mind. If it was magic, it was magic unlike any he was familiar with.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and Arya stared at each other for a moment; then a stir of motion drew Eragon’s eye upward and he saw lines of blood running down her forearms from where the manacles around her wrists had scraped away the skin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Rage engulfed him. He grabbed the chain above him and yanked on it as hard as he could. The links held, but he refused to give up. In a frenzy of anger, he pulled on it again and again, without regard for the harm he was causing himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last he stopped and hung limply while hot blood dripped from his wrists onto the back of his neck and shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Determined to escape, he delved into the flow of energy within his body and, directing the spell at his shackles, he mentally shouted, <span class="italic">Kverst malmr du huildrs edtha, mar frëma né thön eka threyja!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He screamed into his gag as every nerve in his body seared with pain. Unable to maintain his concentration, he lost his grip on the spell, and the enchantment ended.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The pain vanished at once, but it left him devoid of breath, with his heart pounding as heavily as if he had just jumped off a cliff. The experience was similar to the seizures he had suffered before the dragons healed the scar on his back during the Agaetí Blödhren.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he slowly recovered, he saw Arya gazing at him with a concerned expression. <span class="italic">She must have tried a spell herself</span>. Then: <span class="italic">How could this have happened</span>? The two of them bound and helpless, Wyrden dead, the herbalist captured or slain, and Solembum most likely lying hurt somewhere in the underground maze, if the black-clad warriors had not already killed the werecat. Eragon could not understand it. He, Arya, Wyrden, and Angela had been as capable and dangerous a group as any in Alagaësia. And yet they had failed, and he and Arya were at the mercy of their enemies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If we can’t escape</span> … He shied away from the thought; it did not bear dwelling on. More than anything, he wished he could contact Saphira, if only to be assured that she was still safe and to take comfort in her companionship. Though Arya was with him, he felt incredibly alone, and that unnerved him most of all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Despite the agony in his wrists, he resumed pulling on the chain, convinced that if he just kept at it long enough, he could work it loose from the ceiling. He tried twisting it, thinking it would be easier to break that way, but the fetters around his ankles kept him from turning very far to either side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sores on his wrist eventually forced him to stop. They burned like fire, and he was afraid he might end up cutting into muscle if he continued. Also, he worried he might lose too much blood, as the <span>sores</span> were already bleeding heavily, and he did not know how long he and Arya would have to hang there, waiting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was impossible to tell what time it was, but he guessed that they had been captives for only a few hours at the most, given that he did not feel the need to eat, drink, or relieve himself. That would change, though, and then their discomfort would only increase.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The pain in Eragon’s wrists made every minute seem unbearably long. Occasionally, he and Arya would stare at each other and try to communicate, but their efforts always failed. Twice his sores crusted over enough that he risked yanking on the chain again, but to no avail. For the most part, he and Arya <span class="italic">endured</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then, when Eragon had begun to wonder if anyone was ever going to come, he heard the <span class="italic">clang</span> of iron bells from somewhere in the tunnels and passageways, and the doors on either side of the black altar swung open on silent hinges. Eragon’s muscles tensed in anticipation. He fixed his eyes on the openings, as did Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A seemingly endless minute passed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a brash, jarring toll, the bells sounded again, filling the chamber with a swarm of angry echoes. Through the doorways marched three novitiates: young men garbed in golden cloth, each carrying a metal frame hung with bells. Behind them followed twenty-four men and women, not one of whom possessed a full set of limbs. Unlike their predecessors, the cripples wore robes of dark leather, tailored to match their individual infirmities. And last of all, six oiled slaves carried in a bier, upon which, propped upright, rested an armless, legless, toothless, seemingly sexless figure: the High Priest of Helgrind. From its head rose a three-foot-high crest, which only made the creature appear even more misshapen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The priests and novitiates positioned themselves around the edge of the patterned disk on the floor, while the slaves gently lowered the bier onto the altar at the head of the room. Then the three perfect, handsome young men shook the bells once more, creating a discordant crash, and the leather-clad priests chanted a short phrase so quickly that Eragon was not sure what they said, though it <span>had</span> the sound of ritual. Amongst the crush of words, he caught the names of the three peaks of Helgrind: Gorm, Ilda, and Fell Angvara.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The High Priest gazed at him and Arya with eyes like chips of obsidian. “Welcome to the halls of Tosk,” it said, and its withered mouth distorted the words. “Twice now you have invaded our inner sanctums, Dragon Rider. You shall not have the opportunity to do so again. … Galbatorix would have us spare your lives and send you to Urû’baen. He believes he can force you to serve him. He dreams of resurrecting the Riders and restoring the race of dragons. I say his dreams are folly. You are too dangerous, and we do not want to see the dragons resurgent. It is commonly believed that we worship Helgrind. That is a lie we tell others to conceal the true nature of our religion. It is not Helgrind that we revere—it is the Old Ones who made their lair within and to whom we sacrificed our flesh and blood. The Ra’zac are our gods, Dragon Rider—the Ra’zac and the Lethrblaka.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Dread crept through Eragon like a sickness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The High Priest spat at him, and spittle drooled from its slack lower lip. “There is no torture horrible enough for your crime, Rider. You killed our gods, you and that accursed dragon of yours. For that, you must die.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon struggled against his bonds and tried to shout through his gag. If he could talk, he could stall for time by telling them what the Ra’zac’s last words had been, perhaps, or by threatening them with Saphira’s vengeance. But their captors showed no inclination to remove his gag.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In a hideous gesture, the High Priest smiled, showing its gray gums. “You will never escape, Rider. The crystals here were enchanted to trap any who might try to desecrate our temple or steal our treasures, even one such as you. Nor is there anyone to rescue you. Two of your companions are dead—yes, even that meddlesome witch—and Murtagh knows nothing of your presence here. Today is the day of your doom, Eragon <span class="italic">Shadeslayer</span>.” Then the High Priest tilted back its head and uttered a gruesome, gurgling whistle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From the dark doorway to the left of the altar, there appeared four bare-chested slaves. On their shoulders, they bore a platform with two large, shallow, cuplike protrusions in the middle. Within the protrusions lay a pair of oval objects, each about a foot and a half long and half a foot thick. The objects were blue black and pitted like sandstone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Time seemed to slow for Eragon. <span class="italic">They can’t be</span> …, he thought. Saphira’s egg had been smooth, however, and veined like marble. Whatever these objects were, they were not dragon eggs. The alternatives frightened him even more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Since you killed the Old Ones,” said the High Priest, “it is only fitting that you provide the food for their rebirth. You do not deserve such a great honor, but it will please the Old Ones, and in all things we strive to satisfy their desires. We are their faithful servants, and they our masters cruel and implacable: the three-faced god—the hunters of men, the eaters of flesh, and the drinkers of blood. To them, we offer up our bodies in hope of revelation into the mysteries of this life and in hope of absolution for our transgressions. As Tosk wrote, so shall it be.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In unison, the leather-clad priests repeated: “As Tosk wrote, so shall it be.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The High Priest nodded. “The Old Ones have always nested on Helgrind, but in the time of my grandfather’s father, Galbatorix stole their eggs and killed their young, and he forced them to swear fealty to him lest he eradicate their line entirely. He hollowed out the caves and tunnels they have used ever since, and to us, to their devoted acolytes, he gave charge of their eggs—to watch and to hold and to care for until they were needed. This we have done, and none may fault us for our service.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But we pray that someday Galbatorix shall be overthrown, for none should bind the Old Ones to their will. It is an abomination.” The deformed creature licked its lips, and to his disgust, Eragon saw that part of its tongue was missing: carved away by a knife. “You, too, we wish gone, Rider. The dragons were the Old Ones’ greatest <span>enemies</span>. Without them, and without Galbatorix, there would be no one to stop the Old Ones from feasting where and how they will.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the High Priest spoke, the four slaves bearing the platform walked forth and carefully lowered it from their shoulders onto the patterned disk, setting it down several paces in front of Eragon and Arya. Once they finished, they bowed their heads and retreated through the doorway from which they had come.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Who could ask for anything more than to feed a god with the marrow of their bones?” asked the High Priest. “Rejoice, both of you, for today you receive the blessing of the Old Ones, and by your sacrifice, the record of your sins shall be washed clean and you shall enter the afterlife as pure as a newly born child.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the High Priest and its followers raised their faces toward the ceiling and began to intone a strange, oddly accented song that Eragon had trouble understanding. He wondered if it was in the dialect of Tosk. At times, he heard what he thought were words in the ancient language—mangled and misused, but still the ancient language.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When the grotesque congregation finished, ending with another chorus of “As Tosk wrote, so shall it be,” the three novitiates shook the bells in an ecstasy of religious fervor, and the resulting clamor seemed loud enough to bring down the ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Still shaking the bells, the novitiates filed out of the room. The four-and-twenty lesser priests departed next, and then, bringing up the rear of the procession, their limbless master, transported upon its bier by the six oiled slaves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The door closed behind them with an ominous <span class="italic">boom</span>, and Eragon heard a heavy bar fall into place on the other side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He turned to look at Arya. The expression in her eyes was that of despair, and he knew she had no more idea of how to escape than he did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He gazed upward again and pulled on the chain that held him, using as much of his strength as he dared. The sores on his wrists again tore open, and they sprinkled him with drops of blood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In front of them, the leftmost egg began to rock back and forth ever so slightly, and from it came a faint tapping, like the rapping of a tiny hammer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A profound sense of horror suffused Eragon. Of all the ways he could imagine dying, being eaten alive by a Ra’zac was by far the worst. He yanked on the chain with renewed determination, biting his gag to help him withstand the agony in his arms. The resulting pain caused his vision to flicker.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Next to him, Arya thrashed and twisted as well, both of them fighting in deadly silence to free themselves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And still the <span class="italic">tap-tap-tap</span>ping continued on the blue-black shell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It’s no use</span>, Eragon realized. The chain would not give. As soon as he accepted the fact, it became obvious that it would be impossible to avoid being hurt far worse than he already was. The only question was whether his injuries would be forced upon him or whether they would be of his own choosing. <span class="italic">If nothing else, I have to save Arya</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He studied the iron bands around his wrists. <span class="italic">If I can break my thumbs, I might be able to pull my hands out. Then at least I could fight. Maybe I could grab a piece of the Ra’zac’s shell and use it as a knife</span>. With something to cut, he could free his legs as well, though the thought was so terrifying, he ignored it for the time being. <span class="italic">All I would have to do is crawl out of the circle of stones</span>. He would be able to use magic then, and he could stop the pain and the bleeding. What he was considering would only take a few minutes, but he knew they would be the longest minutes of his life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He drew in a breath in preparation. <span class="italic">Left hand first</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before he could start, Arya screamed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He spun toward her and uttered a wordless exclamation as he saw the mangled fingers of her right hand. Her skin was pushed up like a glove toward her nails, and the white of bone showed amid crimson muscle. Arya sagged and appeared to lose consciousness for a moment; then she recovered and pulled on her arm once more. Eragon <span>cried</span> out with her as her hand slid through the metal cuff, tearing off skin and flesh. Her arm fell to her side, hiding the hand from his sight, though he could see the blood splattering on the floor by her feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Tears blurred his eyes, and he shouted her name into his gag, but she seemed not to hear him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As she braced herself to repeat the process, the door to the right of the altar opened, and one of the golden-robed novitiates slipped into the chamber. Seeing him, Arya hesitated, though Eragon knew she would pull her other hand out of the manacle at the slightest hint of danger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The young man looked askance at Arya, then cautiously made his way to the center of the patterned disk, casting apprehensive glances at the egg that was rocking back and forth. The youth was slight, with large eyes and delicate features; it seemed obvious to Eragon that he had been chosen for his position because of his appearance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Here,” whispered the youth. “I brought these.” From within his robes, he produced a file, a chisel, and a wooden mallet. “If I help, you have to take me with you. I can’t stand it here any longer. I hate it. It’s horrible! Promise you’ll take me with you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even before he finished speaking, Eragon was nodding his assent. As the young man started toward him, though, Eragon growled and motioned with his head in Arya’s direction. It took a few seconds before the novitiate understood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oh, yes,” murmured the young man, and went over to Arya instead. Eragon ground his teeth through the gag in anger over the youth’s slowness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The harsh scrape of the file soon drowned out the tapping from within the wobbling egg.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon watched as best he could while their would-be rescuer sawed on a section of chain above Arya’s left hand. <span class="italic">Keep the file on the same link, you fool!</span> Eragon raged. The novitiate looked as if he <span>had</span> never used a file before, and Eragon doubted that the youth had the strength or endurance to cut through even a small amount of metal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya hung limply while the novitiate worked, her long hair covering her face. She trembled at regular intervals, and the fall of blood from her ruined hand continued unabated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To Eragon’s dismay, the file did not seem to be leaving a mark on the chain. Whatever magics protected the metal, they were too strong for something as simple as a file to overcome.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The novitiate huffed, appearing petulant at his lack of progress. He paused and wiped his brow, then, frowning, attacked the chain once again, elbows flailing, chest heaving, the sleeves of his robe flapping wildly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Don’t you realize it’s not going to work</span>? thought Eragon. <span class="italic">Try the chisel on the shackles around her ankles instead</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The young man continued as he was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A sharp <span class="italic">crack</span> echoed through the chamber, and Eragon saw a thin fissure appear at the top of the dark, pitted egg. The fissure lengthened, and a web of hairline fractures spread outward from it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the second egg began to wobble as well, and from it came another <span class="italic">tap-tap-tap</span>ping, which joined with the first to form a maddening rhythm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The novitiate went pale, then dropped the file and backed away from Arya, shaking his head. “I’m sorry. … I’m sorry. It’s too late.” His face crumpled, and tears rolled from his eyes. “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s alarm increased as the young man pulled a dagger from within his robes. “There’s nothing else I can do,” he said, almost as if he were speaking to himself. “Nothing else …” He sniffed and moved toward Eragon. “It’s for the best.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the young man stepped forward, Eragon wrenched at his bonds, trying to pull one of his hands out of the manacles. The iron cuffs were too tight, however, and all he succeeded in doing was scraping more of the skin off his wrists.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m sorry,” whispered the young man as he stopped in front of Eragon and drew back the dagger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No!</span> Eragon shouted in his mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A chunk of glittering amethyst hurtled out of the tunnel that had brought Eragon and Arya to the chamber. It struck the novitiate in the back of the head, and he fell against Eragon. Eragon flinched as he felt the edge of the dagger slide across his ribs. Then the young man tumbled to the floor and lay there, unconscious.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From within the depths of the tunnel emerged a small, limping figure. Eragon stared, and as the figure moved into the light, he saw that it was none other than Solembum.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Relief swept through Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The werecat was in his human form, and he was naked except for a ragged loincloth that looked as if it had been torn from the clothes of their attackers. His spiky black hair stood nearly on end, and a feral snarl disfigured his lips. Several cuts covered his forearms, his left ear hung drooping from the side of his head, and a strip of skin was missing from his scalp. He carried a blood-smeared knife.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And following a few paces behind the werecat was the herbalist, Angela.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_69"></div></body>
