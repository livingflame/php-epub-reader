<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">“AGGGHHH!”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">…</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Will you swear your fealty to me in the ancient language?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Never!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His question and her answer had become a ritual between them, a call-and-response such as children might use in a game, except that in this game she lost even when she won.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Rituals were all that allowed Nasuada to maintain her sanity. By them, she ordered her world—by them, she was able to endure from one moment to the next, for they gave her something to hold on to when all else had been stripped from her. Rituals of thought, rituals of action, rituals of pain and relief: these had become the framework upon which her life depended. Without them, she would have been lost, a sheep without a shepherd, a devotee bereft of faith … a Rider separated from her dragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Unfortunately, this particular ritual always ended in the same way: with another touch of the iron.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She screamed and bit her tongue, and blood filled her mouth. She coughed, trying to clear her throat, but there was too much blood and she began to choke. Her lungs burned from a lack of air, and the lines on the ceiling wavered and grew dim, and then her memory ceased and there was nothing, not even darkness.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Afterward, Galbatorix spoke to her while the irons heated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">This too had become one of their rituals.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He had healed her tongue—at least, she thought it had been him and not Murtagh—for as he said, “It wouldn’t do if you were unable to speak, now would it? How else will I know when you are ready to serve me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As before, the king sat to her right, at the very edge of her vision, where all she could see of him was a gold-edged shadow, his form partially hidden beneath the long, heavy cape he wore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I met your father, you know, when he was steward of Enduriel’s chief estate,” said Galbatorix. “Did he tell you of that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She shuddered and closed her eyes and felt tears seep from the corners. She hated listening to him. His voice was too powerful, too seductive; it left her wanting to do whatever he desired just so she could hear him utter a tiny morsel of praise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes,” she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I took little notice of him at the time. Why would I? He was a servant, no one of significance. Enduriel allowed him a fair bit of freedom, the better to manage the affairs of the estate—too much freedom, as it turned out.” The king made a dismissive gesture, and the light caught his lean, clawlike hand. “Enduriel always was overly permissive. It was his dragon who was the cunning one; Enduriel merely did as he was told. … What a strange, amusing series of events fate has arranged. To think, the man who saw to it that my boots were brightly polished went on to become my foremost enemy after Brom, and now here you are, his daughter, returned to Urû’baen and about to enter my service, even as did your father. How very ironic, would you not agree?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“My father escaped, and he nearly killed Durza when he did,” she said. “All your spells and oaths could not hold him any more than you’ll be able to hold me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She thought Galbatorix might have frowned. “Yes, that was unfortunate. Durza was quite put out about it at the time. Families seem to make it easier for people to change who they are and thus their true names, which is why I now choose my household servants <span>only</span> from those who are barren and unwed. However, you are sorely mistaken if you think to slip your bonds. The only ways to leave the Hall of the Soothsayer are by swearing loyalty to me or by dying.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then I will die.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How very shortsighted.” The gilded shadow of the king leaned toward her. “Have you never entertained the thought, Nasuada, that the world would have been worse off had I not overthrown the Riders?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The Riders kept the peace,” she said. “They protected the whole of Alagaësia from war, from plague … from the threat of Shades. In times of famine, they brought food to the starving. How is this land a better place without them?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Because there was a price attached to their service. You of all people should know that everything in this world must be paid for, whether in gold, time, or blood. Nothing is without its price, not even the Riders. <span class="italic">Especially</span> not the Riders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye, they kept the peace, but they also stifled the races of this land, the elves and dwarves just as much as us humans. What is always said in praise of the Riders when the bards bemoan their passing? That their reign extended for thousands of years, and that during this much-vaunted ‘<span class="italic">golden age</span>,’ little changed besides the names of the kings and queens who sat smug and secure upon their thrones. Oh, there were little alarms: a Shade here, an incursion by Urgals there, a skirmish between two dwarf clans over a mine no one but they cared about. But on the whole, the order of things remained exactly the same as it had been when the Riders first rose to prominence.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She heard the <span class="italic">clink</span> of metal against metal as Murtagh stirred the coals in the brazier. She wished she could see his face so that she could gauge his reaction to Galbatorix’s words, but as was his habit, he stood with his back to her, staring down at the coals. The only time he looked at her was when he had to apply the white-hot metal to her flesh. That was his particular ritual, and she suspected he needed it as much as she needed hers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And still Galbatorix kept talking: “Does that not seem the most evil thing to you, Nasuada? Life is change, and yet the Riders suppressed it so that the land lay in an uneasy slumber, unable to shake off the chains that bound it, unable to advance or retreat as nature intended … unable to become something new. I saw with my own eyes scrolls in the vaults at Vroengard and here, in the vaults of Ilirea, that detailed discoveries—magical, mechanical, and from every sphere of natural philosophy—discoveries that the Riders kept hidden because they feared what might happen if those things became generally known. The Riders were cowards wedded to an old way of life and an old way of thinking, determined to defend it unto their dying breath. Theirs was a gentle tyranny, but a tyranny nevertheless.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Were murder and betrayal really the solution, though?” she asked, not caring if he punished her for it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He laughed, seeming genuinely amused. “Such hypocrisy! You condemn me for the very thing you seek to do. If you could, you would kill me where I sit, and with no more hesitation than were I a rabid dog.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re a traitor; I’m not.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I am the victor. In the end, nothing else matters. We are not so different as you think, Nasuada. You wish to kill me because you believe my death would be an improvement for Alagaësia, and because you—who are still almost a child—believe you can do a better job of ruling the Empire than I. Your arrogance would cause others to despise you. But not me, for I understand. I took up arms against the Riders for those very same reasons, and I was right to do so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Did vengeance have nothing to do with it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She thought he smiled. “It might have provided the initial inspiration, but neither hate nor revenge was my guiding motive. I was concerned by what the Riders had become and convinced, as I still am, that only when they were gone could we flourish as a race.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a moment, the pain from her wounds made it impossible for her to talk. Then she managed to whisper: “If what you say is <span>true</span>—and I have no cause to believe you, but if it is—then you are no better than the Riders. You pillaged their libraries and gathered up their stores of knowledge, and as of yet, you have shared none of that lore with anyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He moved nearer to her, and she felt his breath upon her ear. “That is because, scattered throughout their hoard of secrets, I found hints of a greater truth, a truth that could provide an answer to one of the most perplexing questions in history.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A shiver ran down her spine. “What … question?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He leaned back in his chair and tugged at the edge of his cape. “The question of how a king or a queen can enforce the laws they enact when there are those among their subjects who can use magic. When I realized what the hints alluded to, I put aside all else and committed myself to hunting down this truth, this answer, for I knew it was of paramount importance. That is why I have kept the Riders’ secrets to myself; I have been busy with my search. The answer to this problem must be set into place before I make known any of those other discoveries. The world is already a troubled place, and it is better to soothe the waters before disturbing them once more. … It took me nearly a hundred years to find the information I needed, and now that I have, I shall use it to reshape the whole of Alagaësia.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Magic is the great injustice in the world. It would not be so unfair if the ability only occurred among those who were weak—for then it would be a compensation for what chance or circumstance had robbed them of—but it doesn’t. The strong are just as likely to be able to use magic, and they gain more from it besides. One need only look to the elves to see this is true. The problem is not confined to individuals; it also plagues the relationships between the races. The elves find it easier than us to maintain order within their society, for most every elf can use magic, and, therefore, few of them are ever at the mercy of another. In this regard, they are fortunate, but it is not so fortunate for us, for the dwarves, or even for the accursed Urgals. We have only been able to live here in Alagaësia because the elves permitted it. If they wanted, they could have swept <span>us</span> from the face of the earth as easily as a flood might sweep away an anthill. But no more, not while I am here to oppose their might.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The Riders would never have let them kill us or drive us away.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, but while the Riders existed, we were dependent upon their goodwill, and it is not right that we should have to rely on others for our safekeeping. The Riders began as a means to keep the peace between elves and dragons, but in the end, their main purpose became upholding the rule of law throughout the land. They were, however, insufficient to the task, as are my own spellcasters, the Black Hand. The problem is too far-reaching for any one group to combat. My own life is proof enough of that. Even if there were a trustworthy band of spellcasters adept enough to watch over all the other magicians in Alagaësia—ready to intervene at the slightest hint of malfeasance—we would still be reliant upon the very ones whose powers we sought to restrain. Ultimately, the land would be no safer than it is now. No, in order to solve this problem, it must be addressed on a deeper, more fundamental level. The ancients knew how that might be done, and now so do I.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix shifted in the chair, and she caught a sharp gleam from his eye, as from a lantern set deep within a cave. “I shall make it so that no magician will be able to harm another person, whether human, dwarf, or elf. None shall be able to cast a spell unless they have permission, and only magics that are benign and beneficial shall be allowed. Even the elves will be bound by this precept, and they shall learn to measure their words carefully or speak not at all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And who will grant permission?” she asked. “Who will decide what is allowed and what is not? You?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Someone must. It was I who recognized what was needed, I who discovered the means, and I who shall implement them. You sneer at the thought? Well then, ask yourself this, Nasuada: have I been a bad king? Be honest now. By the standards of my forebears, I have not been excessive.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You have been cruel.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That is not the same thing. … You have led the Varden; you <span>understand</span> the burdens of command. Surely you have realized the threat that magic poses to the stability of any kingdom? To give but one example, I have spent more time laboring over the enchantments that protect the coin of the realm from being forged than I have upon most any other aspect of my duties. And yet, no doubt, there is a clever-minded conjurer somewhere who has found a way to circumvent my wards and who is busy making bags of lead coins with which he can fool nobles and commoners alike. Why else do you think I have been so careful to restrict the use of magic throughout the Empire?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Because it is a threat to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No! There you are exactly wrong. It is no threat to me. No one and nothing is. However, spellcasters <span class="italic">are</span> a threat to the proper functioning of this realm, and that I shall not tolerate. Once I have bound every magician in the world to the laws of the land, imagine the peace and prosperity that shall reign. No more shall men or dwarves have to fear elves. No more shall Riders be able to impose their will on others. No more shall those who cannot use magic be prey for those who can. … Alagaësia will be transformed, and with our newfound safety, we will build a more wondrous tomorrow, one you could be a part of.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Enter into my service, Nasuada, and you will have the opportunity to oversee the creation of a world such as has never existed before—a world where a man will stand or fall based upon the strength of his limbs and the keenness of his mind, and not whether chance has granted him skill with magic. Man may build up his limbs and man may improve his mind, but never can he learn to use magic if he was born lacking the ability. As I said, magic is the great injustice, and for the good of all, I will impose limits upon every magician there is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She stared at the lines on the ceiling and tried to ignore him. So much of what he said <span class="italic">was</span> similar to what she had thought herself. He was right: magic was the most destructive force in the world, <span>and</span> if it could be regulated, Alagaësia would be a better place for it. She hated that there had been nothing to stop Eragon from—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Blue. Red. Patterns of interwoven color. The throbbing of her burns. She strove desperately to concentrate upon anything other than … than nothing. Whatever she had been about to think of was nothing, did not exist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You call me evil. You curse my name and seek to overthrow me. But remember this, Nasuada: it was not I who started this war, and I am not responsible for those who have lost their lives as a result. I did not seek this out. <span class="italic">You</span> did. I would have been content to devote myself to my studies, but the Varden insisted upon stealing Saphira’s egg from my treasure house, and you and your kind are responsible for all of the blood and sorrow that have followed. <span class="italic">You</span> are the ones, after all, who have been rampaging across the countryside, burning and pillaging as you please, not I. And yet you have the audacity to claim that <span class="italic">I</span> am in the wrong! Were you to go into the homes of the peasants, they would tell you that it is the Varden they fear most. They would talk about how they look to my soldiers for protection and how they hope the Empire will defeat the Varden and all shall be as it was.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada wet her lips. Even though she knew her boldness might cost her, she said, “It seems to me you protest too much. … If the welfare of your subjects were your main concern, you would have flown out to confront the Varden weeks ago, instead of letting an army roam loose within your borders. That is, unless you are not so sure of your might as you pretend. Or is it you fear the elves will take Urû’baen while you are gone?” As had become her habit, she spoke of the Varden as if she knew no more about them than any random person in the Empire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix shifted, and she could tell he was about to respond, but she was not yet finished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And what of the Urgals? You cannot convince me your cause is just when you would exterminate an entire race in order to ease <span>your</span> pain at the death of your first dragon. Have you no answer for that, Oath-breaker? … Speak to me of the dragons, then. Explain why you slew so many that you doomed their kind to a slow and inevitable extinction. And finally, explain your mistreatment of the Eldunarí you captured.” In her anger, she allowed herself that one slip. “You have bent and broken them and chained them to your will. There is no rightness in what you do, only selfishness and a never-ending hunger for power.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix regarded her in silence for a long, uncomfortable while. Then she saw his outline move as he crossed his arms. “I think the irons ought to be sufficiently hot by now. Murtagh, if you would …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She clenched her fists, digging her nails into her skin, and her muscles began to tremble, despite her best efforts to hold them still. One of the iron rods scraped against the lip of the brazier as Murtagh pulled it free. He turned to face her, and she could not help but stare at the tip of the glowing metal. Then she looked into Murtagh’s eyes, and she saw the guilt and self-loathing they contained, and a sense of profound sorrow overcame her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What fools we are</span>, she thought. <span class="italic">What sorry, miserable fools</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After that, she had no more energy for thinking, and so she fell back to her well-worn rituals, clinging to them for survival even as a drowning man might cling to a piece of wood.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">When Murtagh and Galbatorix departed, she was in too much pain to do more than gaze mindlessly at the patterns on the ceiling while she struggled not to cry. She was sweating and shivering at the same time, as if she had a fever, and she found it impossible to concentrate upon any one thing for more than a few seconds. The pain from her burns did not subside as it would have if she had been cut or bruised; indeed, the throbbing from her wounds seemed to grow worse with time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She closed her eyes and concentrated upon slowing her breathing as she tried to calm her body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The first time Galbatorix and Murtagh had visited her, she had been far more courageous. She had cursed and taunted them and done all she could to hurt them with her words. However, through Murtagh, Galbatorix had made her suffer for her insolence, and she had soon lost her taste for open rebellion. The iron made her timid; even the memory of it made her want to curl into a tight little ball. During their second, most recent visit, she had said as little as possible until her final, imprudent outburst.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She had tried to test Galbatorix’s claim that neither he nor Murtagh would lie to her. She did this by asking them questions about the Empire’s inner workings, facts that her spies had informed her of but that Galbatorix had no reason to believe she knew. So far as she could determine, Galbatorix and Murtagh had told her the truth, but she was not about to trust anything the king said when there was no way to verify his claims.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As for Murtagh, she was not quite so sure. When he was with the king, she gave no credence to his words, but when he was by himself …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Several hours after her first, agonizing audience with King Galbatorix—when she had at long last fallen into a shallow, troubled sleep—Murtagh had come alone to the Hall of the Soothsayer, bleary-eyed and smelling of drink. He had stood by the monolith upon which she lay, and he had stared at her with such a strange, tormented expression, she had not been sure what he was going to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last he had turned away, walked to the nearest wall, and slid down it to the floor. There he sat, with his knees pulled up against his chest, his long, shaggy hair obscuring most of his face, and blood oozing from the torn skin on the knuckles of his right hand. After what felt like minutes, he had reached into his maroon jerkin—for he was wearing the same clothes as earlier, although without the mask—and drawn forth a small stone bottle. He drank several times and then began to talk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He talked, and she listened. She had no choice, but she did not <span>allow</span> herself to believe what he said. Not at first. For all she knew, everything he said or did was a sham designed to win her confidence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh had started by telling her a rather garbled story about a man named Tornac, which involved a riding mishap and some sort of advice Tornac had given him regarding how an honorable man ought to live. She had been unable to make out whether Tornac was a friend, a servant, a distant relative, or some combination thereof, but whatever he was, it was obvious that he had meant a great deal to Murtagh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he concluded his story, Murtagh had said, “Galbatorix was going to have you killed. … He knew Elva wasn’t guarding you as she used to, so he decided it was the perfect time to have you assassinated. I only found out about his plan by chance; I happened to be with him when he gave the orders to the Black Hand.” Murtagh shook his head. “It’s my fault. I convinced him to have you brought here instead. He liked that; he knew you would lure Eragon here that much faster. … It was the only way I could keep him from killing you. … I’m sorry. … I’m sorry.” And he buried his head in his arms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would rather have died.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know,” he said in a hoarse voice. “Will you forgive me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">That she had not answered. His revelation only made her more uneasy. Why should he care to save her life, and what did he expect in return?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh had said nothing more for a while. Then, sometimes weeping and sometimes raging, he told her of his upbringing in Galbatorix’s court, of the distrust and jealousy he had faced as the son of Morzan, of the nobles who had sought to use him to win favor with the king, and of his longing for the mother he barely remembered. Twice he mentioned Eragon and cursed him for a fool favored by fortune. “He would not have done so well if our places had been reversed. But our mother chose to take <span class="italic">him</span> to Carvahall, not me.” He spat on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She found the whole episode maudlin and self-pitying, and his weakness did nothing but inspire contempt in her until he recounted how the Twins had abducted him from Farthen Dûr, how they had mistreated him on the way to Urû’baen, and how Galbatorix had broken him once they arrived. Some of the tortures he described were worse than her own and, if true, gave her a slight measure of sympathy for his own plight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Thorn was my undoing,” Murtagh finally confessed. “When he hatched for me and we bonded …” He shook his head. “I love him. How could I not? I love him even as Eragon loves Saphira. The moment I touched him, I was lost. Galbatorix used him against me. Thorn was stronger than me. He never gave up. But I could not bear to see him suffer, so I swore my loyalty to the king, and after that …” Murtagh’s lips curled with revulsion. “After that, Galbatorix went into my mind. He learned everything about me, and then he taught me my true name. And now I am his. … His forever.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he leaned his head against the wall and closed his eyes, and she watched the tears roll down his cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eventually, he stood, and as he walked toward the door, he paused next to her and touched her on the shoulder. His nails, she noted, were clean and trimmed, but nowhere near as well cared for as her jailer’s. He murmured a few words in the ancient language, and a moment later, her pain melted away, although her wounds looked the same as ever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he took his hand away, she said, “I cannot forgive … but I understand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Whereupon he nodded and stumbled away, leaving her to wonder if she had found a new ally.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_102"></div></body>
