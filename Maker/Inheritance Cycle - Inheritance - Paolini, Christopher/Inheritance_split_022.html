<h2 id="filepos384599" class="calibre1"><span class="calibre2">A<span class="calibre12"><span class="calibre26">ROUGHS</span></span></span></h2><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">IT WAS MIDMORNING</span></span> when Roran and his men arrived at the cluster of tents next to the road. The camp appeared gray and indistinct through the haze of exhaustion that clouded Roran’s vision. A mile to the south lay the city of Aroughs, but he was able to make out only the most general features: glacier-white walls, yawning entryways containing barred gates, and many thickly built square stone towers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He clung to the front of the saddle as they trotted into the camp, their horses near to collapsing. A scraggly-looking youngster ran up to him and grabbed the bridle of his mare, pulling on it until the animal stumbled to a stop.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran stared down at the boy, not sure what had just happened, and after a long moment croaked, “Bring me Brigman.” Without a word, the boy took off between the tents, kicking up dust with his bare heels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It seemed to Roran that he sat waiting for over an hour. The mare’s uncontrollable panting matched the rushing of blood in his ears. When he looked at the ground, it appeared as if it were still moving, receding tunnel-like toward a point infinitely far away. Somewhere, spurs clinked. A dozen or so warriors gathered nearby, leaning on spears and shields, their faces open displays of curiosity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From across the camp, a broad-shouldered man in a blue tunic limped toward Roran, using a broken spear as a staff. He had a large, full beard, though his upper lip was shaved and it glittered with perspiration—whether from pain or heat Roran could not tell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re Stronghammer?” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran grunted an affirmative. He released his cramped grip on the <span>saddle</span>, reached inside his tunic, and handed Brigman the battered rectangle of parchment that contained his orders from Nasuada.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brigman broke the wax seal with his thumbnail. He studied the parchment, then lowered it and gazed at Roran with a flat expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We’ve been expecting you,” he said. “One of Nasuada’s pet spellcasters contacted me four days ago and said you had departed, but I didn’t think you would arrive so soon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It wasn’t easy,” said Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brigman’s bare upper lip curled. “No, I’m sure it wasn’t … sir.” He handed the parchment back. “The men are yours to command, Stronghammer. We were about to launch an attack on the western gate. Perhaps you would care to lead the charge?” The question was as pointed as a dagger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The world seemed to tilt around Roran, and he gripped the saddle tighter. He was too tired to bandy words with anyone and do it well, and he knew it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Order them to stand down for the day,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Have you lost your wits? How else do you expect us to capture the city? It took us all morning to prepare the attack, and I’m not going to sit here twiddling my thumbs while you catch up on your sleep. Nasuada expects us to end the siege within a few days, and by Angvard, I’ll see it done!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In a voice pitched so low that only Brigman could hear, Roran growled, “You’ll tell the men to stand down, or I’ll have you strung up by your ankles and whipped for breaking orders. I’m not about to approve any sort of attack until I’ve had a chance to rest and look at the situation.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re a fool, you are. That would—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“If you can’t hold your tongue and do your duty, I’ll thrash you myself—right here and now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brigman’s nostrils flared. “In your state? You wouldn’t stand a chance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re wrong,” said Roran. And he meant it. He was not sure <span>how</span> he might beat Brigman right then, but he knew in the deepest fibers of his being that he could.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brigman seemed to struggle with himself. “Fine,” he spat. “It wouldn’t be good for the men to see us sprawling in the dirt anyway. We’ll stay where we are, if that’s what you want, but I won’t be held accountable for the waste of time. Be it on your head, not mine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“As it always is,” said Roran, his throat tight with pain as he swung down from the mare. “Just as you’re responsible for the mess you’ve made of this siege.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brigman’s brow darkened, and Roran saw the man’s dislike of him curdle and turn to hate. He wished that he had chosen a more diplomatic response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Your tent is this way.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">It was still morning when Roran woke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A soft light diffused through the tent, lifting his spirits. For a moment, he thought he had only fallen asleep for a few minutes. Then he realized he felt too bright and alert for that to be the case.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He cursed quietly to himself, angry that he had allowed an entire day to slip through his fingers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A thin blanket covered him, mostly unneeded in the balmy southern weather, especially since he was wearing his boots and clothes underneath. He pulled it off, then tried to sit upright.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A choked groan escaped him as his entire body seemed to stretch and tear. He fell back and lay gasping at the fabric above. The initial shock soon subsided, but it left behind a multitude of throbbing aches—some worse than others.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took him several minutes to gather his strength. With a massive effort, he rolled onto his side and swung his legs over the edge of the cot. He stopped to catch his breath before attempting the seemingly impossible task of standing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once he was on his feet, he smiled sourly. It was going to be an interesting day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The others were already up and waiting for him when he made <span>his</span> way out of the tent. They looked worn and haggard; their movements were as stiff as his own. After exchanging greetings, Roran motioned toward the bandage on Delwin’s forearm, where a tavern keeper had cut him with a paring knife. “Has the pain gone down?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Delwin shrugged. “It’s not so bad. I can fight if need be.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Good.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What do you intend to do first?” Carn asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran eyed the rising sun, calculating how much time remained until noon. “Take a walk,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Starting from the center of the camp, Roran led his companions up and down each row of tents, inspecting the condition of the troops as well as the state of their equipment. Occasionally, he stopped to question a warrior before moving on. For the most part, the men were tired and disheartened, although he noticed their mood seemed to improve when they caught sight of him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran’s tour ended at the southern edge of the camp, as he had planned. There he and the others stopped to gaze at the imposing edifice that was Aroughs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The city had been built in two tiers. The first was low and spread out and contained the majority of buildings, while the second, smaller tier occupied the top of a long, gentle rise, which was the tallest point for miles around. A wall encircled both levels of the city. Five gates were visible within the outer wall: two of them opened to roads that entered the city—one from the north and one from the east—and the other three sat astride canals that flowed southward, into the city. On the other side of Aroughs lay the restless sea, where the canals presumably emptied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">At least they don’t have a moat</span>, he thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The north-facing gate was scratched and scarred from a battering ram, and the ground in front of it was torn up with what Roran recognized as the tracks of battle. Three catapults, four ballistae of the sort he had knowledge of from his time on the <span class="italic">Dragon Wing</span>, and two ramshackle siege towers were arrayed before the outer wall. <span>A</span> handful of men hunkered next to the machines of war, smoking pipes and playing dice on patches of leather. The machines appeared pitifully inadequate compared with the monolithic mass of the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The low, flat land surrounding Aroughs sloped downward toward the sea. Hundreds of farms dotted the green plain, each marked by a wooden fence and at least one thatched hut. Sumptuous estates stood here and there: sprawling stone manors protected by their own high walls and, Roran assumed, by their own guards. No doubt they belonged to the nobles of Aroughs, and perhaps certain well-off merchants.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What do you think?” he asked Carn.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The magician shook his head, his drooping eyes even more mournful than usual. “We might as well lay siege to a mountain for all the good it’ll do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Indeed,” observed Brigman, walking up to them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran kept his own observations to himself; he did not want the others to know how discouraged he was. <span class="italic">Nasuada is mad if she believes we can capture Aroughs with only eight hundred men. If I had eight thousand, and Eragon and Saphira to boot, then I might be sure of it. But not like this</span>. …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Yet he knew he had to find a way, for Katrina’s sake, if nothing else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without looking at him, Roran said to Brigman, “Tell me about Aroughs.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brigman twisted his spear several times, grinding the butt of it into the ground, before he replied: “Galbatorix had foresight; he saw to it that the city was fully stocked with food before we cut off the roads between here and the rest of the Empire. Water, as you can see, they have no shortage of. Even if we diverted the canals, they would still have several springs and wells inside the city. They could conceivably hold out until winter, if not longer, although I’d wager they’d be right sick of eating turnips before all was said <span>and</span> done. Also, Galbatorix garrisoned Aroughs with a fair number of soldiers—more than twice what we have—in addition to their usual contingent.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How do you know this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“An informant. However, he had no experience with military strategy, and he provided us with an overly confident assessment of Aroughs’s weaknesses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He also promised us that he would be able to let a small force of men into the city under the cover of dark.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We waited, but he never appeared, and we saw his head mounted over the parapet the following morning. It’s still there, by the eastern gate.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“So it is. Are there other gates besides these five?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye, three more. By the docks, there’s a water gate wide enough for all three streams to run out at once, and next to it a dry gate for men and horses. Then there’s another dry gate over at that end”—he pointed toward the western side of the city—“same as the others.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Can any of them be breached?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not quickly. By the shore, we haven’t room to maneuver properly or withdraw out of range of the soldiers’ stones and arrows. That leaves us with these gates, and the western one as well. The lay of the land is much the same all around the city, except for the shore, so I chose to concentrate our attack on the nearest gate.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What are they made of?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Iron and oak. They’ll stand for hundreds of years unless we knock them down.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Are they protected by any spells?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I wouldn’t know, seeing as how Nasuada didn’t see fit to send one of her magicians with us. Halstead has—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Halstead?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Lord Halstead, ruler of Aroughs. You must have heard of him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A brief pause followed, wherein Roran could sense Brigman’s contempt for him growing. Then the man continued, “Halstead has a conjurer of his own: a mean, sallow-looking creature we’ve seen atop the walls, muttering into his beard and trying to strike us down with his spells. He seems to be singularly incompetent, because he hasn’t had much luck, save for two of the men I had on the battering ram, whom he managed to set on fire.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran exchanged glances with Carn—the magician appeared even more worried than before—but he decided it would be better to discuss the matter in private.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Would it be easier to break through the gates on the canals?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Where would you stand? Look at how they’re recessed within the wall, without so much as a step for purchase. What’s more, there are slits and trapdoors in the roof of the entryway, so they can pour boiling oil, drop boulders, or fire crossbows at anyone foolish enough to venture in there.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The gates can’t be solid all the way down, or they would block the water.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re right about that. Below the surface is a latticework of wood and metal with holes large enough that they don’t impede the flow overly much.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I see. Are the gates kept lowered into the water most of the time, even when Aroughs isn’t under siege?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“At night for certain, but I believe they were left open during the daylight hours.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mmh. And what of the walls?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brigman shifted his weight. “Granite, polished smooth, and fit so closely together, you can’t even slide a knife blade between the blocks. Dwarf work, I’d guess, from before the fall of the Riders. I’d also guess that the walls are filled with packed rubble, but I can’t say for sure, since we haven’t cracked the outer sheathing yet. They extend at least twelve feet below ground and probably more, which means we can’t tunnel under them or weaken them with sapping.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Stepping forward, Brigman pointed at the manors to the north and west. “Most of the nobles have retreated into Aroughs, but they left men behind to protect their property. They’ve given us some trouble, attacking our scouts, stealing our horses, that sort of thing. We captured two of the estates early on”—he indicated a pair of burnt-out husks a few miles away—“but holding them was more trouble than it was worth, so we sacked them and put them to the torch. Unfortunately, we don’t have enough men to secure the rest.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Baldor spoke then. “Why do the canals feed into Aroughs? It doesn’t look as if they’re used for watering crops.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You don’t need to water here, lad, any more than a northman needs to cart in snow during the winter. Staying dry is more a problem than not.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then what are they used for?” Roran inquired. “And where do they come from? You can’t expect me to believe the water is drawn from the Jiet River, so many leagues away.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Hardly,” scoffed Brigman. “There are lakes in the marshes north of us. It’s brackish, unwholesome water, but the people here are accustomed to it. A single channel carries it from the marshes to a point about three miles away. There the channel divides into the three canals you see here, and they run over a series of falls, which power the mills that grind flour for the city. The peasants cart their grain to the mills at harvesttime, and then the sacks of flour are loaded onto barges and floated down to Aroughs. It’s also a handy way of moving other goods, like timber and wine, from the manor houses to the city.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran rubbed the back of his neck as he continued to examine Aroughs. What Brigman had told him intrigued him, but he was not sure how it could help. “Is there anything else of significance in the surrounding countryside?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Only a slate mine farther south along the coast.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He grunted, still thinking. “I want to visit the mills,” he said. “But first I want to hear a full account of your time here, and I want <span>to</span> know how well provisioned we are with everything from arrows to biscuits.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“If you’ll follow me … Stronghammer.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">The next hour Roran spent in conference with Brigman and two of his lieutenants, listening and asking questions as they recounted each of the assaults they had launched against the city walls, as well as cataloging the stocks of supplies left to the warriors under his command.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">At least we’re not short of weapons</span>, Roran thought as he counted the number of dead. Yet even if Nasuada had not set a time limit upon his mission, the men and horses did not have enough food to stay camped before Aroughs for more than another week.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Many of the facts and figures that Brigman and his lackeys related came from writing on scrolls of parchment. Roran strove to conceal the fact that he could not decipher the rows of angular black marks by insisting that the men read everything to him, but it irritated him that he was at the mercy of others. <span class="italic">Nasuada was right</span>, he realized. <span class="italic">I have to learn to read, else I cannot tell if someone is lying to me when they say that a piece of parchment says one thing or another. … Maybe Carn can teach me on our return to the Varden</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The more Roran learned about Aroughs, the more he began to sympathize with Brigman’s plight; capturing the city was a daunting task with no obvious solution. Despite his dislike for the man, Roran thought that the captain had done as well as could be expected under the circumstances. He had failed, Roran believed, not because he was an incompetent commander, but because he lacked the two qualities that had granted Roran victory time and time again: daring and imagination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Upon finishing his review, Roran and his five companions rode with Brigman to inspect Aroughs’s walls and gates from a closer, but still safe, distance. Sitting in a saddle again was incredibly painful for Roran, but he bore it without complaint.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As their steeds clattered onto the stone-paved road next to the camp and began to trot toward the city, Roran noticed that, on occasion, the horses’ hooves produced a peculiar noise when they struck the ground. He remembered hearing a similar sound, and being bothered by it, during their final day of traveling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Looking down, he saw that the flat stones that formed the surface of the road seemed to be set within tarnished silver, the veins of which formed an irregular, cobweb-like pattern.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran called out to Brigman and asked him about it, whereupon Brigman shouted, “The dirt here makes for poor mortar, so instead they use lead to hold the stones in place!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran’s initial reaction was disbelief, but Brigman appeared serious. He found it astonishing that any metal could be so common that people would squander it on building a road.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So they trotted down the lane of stone and lead toward the gleaming city beyond.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They studied Aroughs’s defenses with great attentiveness. But their increased proximity revealed nothing new and only served to reinforce Roran’s impression that the city was nigh on impregnable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He guided his horse over to Carn’s. The magician was staring at Aroughs with a glazed expression, his lips moving silently, as if he were talking to himself. Roran waited until he stopped, then quietly asked, “Are there any spells on the gates?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I think so,” Carn replied, equally subdued, “but I’m not sure how many or what their intended purpose is. I’ll need more time to tease out the answers.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why is it so difficult?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s not, really. Most spells are easy to detect, unless someone has made an effort to hide them, and even then, the magic usually leaves certain telltale traces if you know what to look for. My concern is that one or more of the spells might be traps set to prevent people from meddling with the gates’ enchantments. If that’s so, and I approach them directly, I’ll be sure to trigger them, and then who knows what will happen? I might dissolve into a puddle <span>before</span> your very eyes, which is a fate I would rather avoid, if I have my way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you want to stay here while we continue on?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Carn shook his head. “I don’t think it would be wise to leave you unguarded while we’re away from camp. I’ll return after sundown and see what I can do then. Besides, it would help if I were closer to the gates, and I don’t dare go any nearer now, when I’m in plain sight of the sentinels.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“As you wish.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Roran was satisfied they had learned everything they could by looking at the city, he had Brigman lead them to the nearest set of mills.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They were much as Brigman had described. The water in the canal flowed over three consecutive twenty-foot falls. At the base of each fall was a waterwheel, edged with buckets. The water splashed into the buckets, driving the machine round and round. The wheels were connected by thick axles to three identical buildings that stood stacked one above the other along the terraced bank and which contained the massive grindstones needed to produce the flour for Aroughs’s population. Though the wheels were moving, Roran could tell they were disengaged from the complex arrangement of gears hidden inside the buildings, for he did not hear the rumble of the grindstones turning in their places.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He dismounted by the lowest mill and walked up the path between the buildings, eyeing the sluice gates that were above the falls and that controlled the amount of water released into them. The gates were open, but a deep pool of water still lay beneath each of the three slowly spinning wheels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He stopped halfway up the hill and planted his feet on the edge of the soft, grassy bank, crossed his arms, and tucked his chin against his chest while he pondered how he could possibly capture Aroughs. That there was a trick or a strategy that would allow him to crack open the city like a ripe gourd, he was confident, but the solution eluded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He thought until he was tired of thinking, and then he gave himself over to the creaking of the turning axles and the splashing of the falling water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Soothing as those sounds were, a thorn of unease still rankled him, for the place reminded him of Dempton’s mill in Therinsford, where he had gone to work the day the Ra’zac had burned down his home and tortured his father, mortally wounding him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran tried to ignore the memory, but it stayed with him, twisting in his gut.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If only I had waited another few hours to leave, I could have saved him</span>. Then the more practical part of Roran replied: <span class="italic">Yes, and the Ra’zac would have killed me before I could have even raised a hand. Without Eragon to protect me, I would have been as helpless as a newborn babe</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a quiet step, Baldor joined him by the edge of the canal. “The others are wondering: have you decided on a plan?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I have ideas, but no plan. What of you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Baldor crossed his arms as well. “We could wait for Nasuada to send Eragon and Saphira to our aid.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Bah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a while, they watched the never-ending motion of the water below them. Then Baldor said, “What if you just asked them to surrender? Maybe they’ll be so frightened when they hear your name, they’ll throw open the gates, fall at your feet, and beg for mercy.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran chuckled briefly. “I doubt word of me has reached all the way to Aroughs. Still …” He ran his fingers through his beard. “It might be worth a try, to put them off balance if nothing else.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Even if we gain entrance to the city, can we hold it with so few men?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Maybe, maybe not.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A pause grew between them; then Baldor said, “How far we have come.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again, the only sound was that of the water and of the turning wheels. Finally, Baldor said, “The snowmelt must not be as great <span>here</span> as it is at home. Otherwise, the wheels would be half underwater come springtime.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran shook his head. “It doesn’t matter how much snow or rain they get. The sluice gates can be used to limit the amount of water that runs over the wheels, so they don’t turn too fast.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But once the water rises to the top of the gates?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Hopefully, the day’s grinding is finished by then, but in any case, you uncouple the gears, raise the gates, and …” Roran trailed off as a series of images flashed through his mind, and his whole body flushed with warmth, as if he had drunk an entire tankard of mead in a single gulp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Could I</span>? he thought wildly. <span class="italic">Would it really work, or … It doesn’t matter; we have to try. What else can we do</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He strode out to the center of the berm that held back the middlemost pond and grasped the spokes that stuck out from the tall wooden screw used to raise and lower the sluice gate. The screw was stiff and hard to move, even though he set his shoulder against it and pushed with all his weight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Help me,” he said to Baldor, who had remained on the bank, watching with puzzled interest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Baldor carefully made his way to where Roran stood. Together they managed to close the sluice gate. Then, refusing to answer any questions, Roran insisted that they do the same with both the uppermost and the lowermost gates.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When all three were firmly shut, Roran walked back to Carn, Brigman, and the others and motioned for them to climb off their horses and gather around him. He tapped the head of his hammer while he waited, suddenly feeling unreasonably impatient.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well?” Brigman demanded once they were in place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran looked each of them in the eyes, to make sure that he had their undivided attention, then he said, “Right, this is what we’re going to do—” And he began to talk, quickly and intensely, for a full half hour, explaining everything that had occurred to him in that one, revelatory instant. As he spoke, Mandel began <span>to</span> grin, and though they remained more serious, Baldor, Delwin, and Hamund also appeared excited by the audacious nature of the scheme he outlined.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Their response gratified Roran. He had done much to earn their trust, and he was pleased to know that he could still count on their support. His only fear was that he might let them down; of all the fates he could imagine, only losing Katrina seemed worse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Carn, on the other hand, appeared somewhat doubtful. This Roran had expected, but the magician’s doubt was slight compared with Brigman’s incredulity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re mad!” he exclaimed once Roran had finished. “It’ll never succeed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You take that back!” said Mandel, and jumped forward, his fists clenched. “Why, Roran’s won more battles than you’ve ever fought in, and he did it without all the warriors you’ve had to order around!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brigman snarled, his bare upper lip curling like a snake. “You little whelp! I’ll teach you a lesson in respect you’ll never forget.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran pushed Mandel back before the younger man could attack Brigman. “Oi!” growled Roran. “Behave yourself.” With a surly look, Mandel ceased resisting, but he continued to glower at Brigman, who sneered at him in return.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s an outlandish plan, to be sure,” said Delwin, “but then, your outlandish plans have served us well in the past.” The other men from Carvahall made sounds of agreement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Carn nodded and said, “Maybe it will work and maybe it won’t. I don’t know. In any event, it’s certain to catch our enemies by surprise, and I have to admit, I’m rather curious to see what will happen. Nothing like this has ever been tried before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran smiled slightly. Addressing Brigman, he said, “To continue as before, now <span class="italic">that</span> would be mad. We have only two and a half days to seize Aroughs. Ordinary methods won’t suffice, so we must hazard the <span class="italic">extra</span>ordinary.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That may be,” muttered Brigman, “but this is a ridiculous <span>venture</span> that will kill many a good man, and for no reason other than to demonstrate your supposed cleverness.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His smile widening, Roran moved toward Brigman until only a few inches separated them. “You don’t have to agree with me, Brigman; you only have to do what you’re told. Now, will you follow my orders or not?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The air between them grew warm from their breath and from the heat radiating off their skin. Brigman gritted his teeth and twisted his spear even more vigorously than before, but then his gaze wavered and he backed away. “Blast you,” he said. “I’ll be your dog for the while, Stronghammer, but there’ll be a reckoning on this soon enough, just you watch, and then you’ll have to answer for your decisions.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">As long as we capture Aroughs</span>, thought Roran, <span class="italic">I don’t care</span>. “Mount up!” he shouted. “We have work to do, and little time to do it in! Hurry, hurry, hurry!”</span></p>
