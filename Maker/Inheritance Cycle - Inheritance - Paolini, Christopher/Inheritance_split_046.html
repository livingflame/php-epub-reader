<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON SEARCHED THROUGH</span></span>
<span class="italic">Domia abr Wyrda</span> until he found the reference to Kuthian in the twelfth chapter. To his disappointment, all it said was that Kuthian had been one of the first Riders to explore Vroengard Island.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Afterward, he closed the book and sat staring at it, thumbing a ridge embossed across the spine. On the cot, Solembum was silent as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you think that the Vault of Souls contains spirits?” asked Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Spirits are not the souls of the dead</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, but what else could they be?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum rose from where he had been sitting and stretched, a wave of motion moving through his body from his head to his tail. <span class="italic">If you find out, I would be interested to hear what you discover</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you think Saphira and I should go, then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I cannot tell you what you should do. If this is a trap, then most of my race has been broken and enslaved without them realizing it, and the Varden might as well surrender now, because they will never outwit Galbatorix. If not, then this may be an opportunity to find assistance where we thought none was to be had. I cannot say. You have to decide on your own whether it is a chance worth taking. As for me, I have had enough of this mystery</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He jumped down from the cot and walked over to the opening of the tent, where he paused and glanced back at Eragon. <span class="italic">There are many strange forces at work in Alagaësia, Shadeslayer. I have seen things that defy belief: whirlwinds of light spinning in caverns deep below <span>the</span> ground, men who age backward, stones that speak, and shadows that creep. Rooms that are bigger on the inside than the outside. … Galbatorix is not the only power in the world to be reckoned with, and he may not even be the strongest. Choose carefully, Shadeslayer, and if you choose to go, walk softly</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And then the werecat slipped out of the tent and vanished into the darkness.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Eragon released his breath and leaned back. He knew what he had to do; he had to go to Vroengard. But he could not make that decision without consulting Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a gentle nudge of his mind, he woke her, and once he had assured her that nothing was amiss, he shared his memories of Solembum’s visit. Her astonishment was as great as his.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he finished, she said, <span class="italic">I do not like the thought of playing the puppet to whoever has enchanted the werecats</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Neither do I, but what other choice do we have? If Galbatorix is behind this, then we’ll be placing ourselves in his hands. But if we stay, then we’ll be doing exactly the same, only when we arrive at Urû’baen</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The difference is, we would have the Varden and the elves with us</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">That’s true</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Silence fell between them for a time. Then Saphira said, <span class="italic">I agree. I agree; we should go. We need longer claws and sharper teeth if we are to best Galbatorix and Shruikan in addition to Murtagh and Thorn. Besides, Galbatorix expects us to rush straight to Urû’baen in hope of rescuing Nasuada. And if there is one thing that makes my scales itch, it is doing what our enemies expect</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded. <span class="italic">And if this is a trap</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A soft growl sounded outside the tent. <span class="italic">Then we will teach whoever set it to fear our names, even if it is Galbatorix</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He smiled. For the first time since Nasuada’s abduction, he felt a sense of purposeful direction. Here was something they could <span class="italic">do</span>—a means by which they could influence the unfolding of events, <span>instead</span> of just sitting by as passive observers. “Right, then,” he muttered.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Arya arrived at his tent mere seconds after he contacted her. Her speed puzzled him until she explained that she had been keeping watch with Blödhgarm and the other elves, lest Murtagh and Thorn return.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With her there, Eragon reached out with his mind to Glaedr and coaxed him into joining their conversation, though the surly dragon was in no mood to talk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once the four of them, including Saphira, were all joined by their thoughts, Eragon finally burst out, <span class="italic">I know where the Rock of Kuthian is!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What rock is this</span>? Glaedr rumbled, his tone sour.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The name seems familiar</span>, said Arya, <span class="italic">but I cannot place it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon frowned slightly. Both of them had heard him speak of Solembum’s advice before. It was not like either of them to forget.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nevertheless, Eragon repeated the story of his encounter with Solembum in Teirm, and then he told them about the werecat’s most recent revelations and read them the pertinent section from the book <span class="italic">Domia abr Wyrda</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya tucked a strand of hair behind one of her pointed ears. Speaking both with her mind and her voice, she said, “And what is the name of this place again?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“… Moraeta’s Spire, or the Rock of Kuthian,” replied Eragon in the same manner. He hesitated for a half second, briefly thrown by her question. “It’s a long flight, but—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">—if Eragon and I leave forthwith</span>—said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“—we can travel there and back—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">—before the Varden arrive at Urû’baen. This</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“—is our only chance to go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We’ll not have the time</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“—to make the trip later on.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Where would you be flying to, though</span>? asked Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What … what do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Exactly what I said</span>, the dragon growled, the field of his mind darkening. <span class="italic">For all your yammering, you’ve yet to tell us where this mysterious … thing is located</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I have, though!” said Eragon, bewildered. “It’s on Vroengard Island!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">At last, a straightforward answer</span> …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A frown creased Arya’s brow. “But what would you <span class="italic">do</span> on Vroengard?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t know!” said Eragon, his temper rising. He debated whether it was worth confronting Glaedr about his remarks; the dragon seemed to be needling Eragon on purpose. “It depends on what we find. Once we’re there, we’ll try to open the Rock of Kuthian and discover whatever secrets it contains. If it’s a trap …” He shrugged. “Then we’ll fight.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya’s expression grew increasingly troubled. “The Rock of Kuthian … The name seems weighted with significance, but I cannot say why; it echoes in my mind, like a song I once knew but have since forgotten.” She shook her head and put her hands to her temples. “Ah, now it is gone. …” She looked up. “Forgive me, what were we speaking of?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Going to Vroengard,” Eragon said slowly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah, yes … but for what purpose? You’re needed here, Eragon. In any case, nothing of value remains on Vroengard.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Aye</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">It is a dead and abandoned place. After the destruction of Doru Araeba, the few of us who had escaped returned to search for anything that might be of use, but the Forsworn had already picked the ruins clean</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya nodded. “Whatever put this idea in your head in the first place? I don’t understand how you could believe deserting the Varden now, when they’re at their most vulnerable, could possibly be wise. And for what? To fly to the far ends of Alagaësia <span>without</span> cause or reason? I had thought better of you. … You cannot leave just because you are uncomfortable with your new station, Eragon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon decoupled his mind from Arya and Glaedr, and signaled to Saphira to do the same. <span class="italic">They don’t remember! … They</span> can’t <span class="italic">remember!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It is magic. Deep magic, like the spell that hides the names of the dragons who betrayed the Riders</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">But you haven’t forgotten about the Rock of Kuthian, have you</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Of course not</span>, she said, her mind flashing green with pique. <span class="italic">How could I when we are so closely joined</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A sense of vertigo gripped Eragon as he considered the implications. <span class="italic">In order to be effective, the spell would have to erase the memories of everyone who knew about the rock in the first place and also the memories of anyone who heard or read about it thereafter. Which means … the whole of Alagaësia is in the thrall of this enchantment. No one can escape its reach</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Except for us</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Except for us</span>, he agreed. <span class="italic">And the werecats</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And, perhaps, Galbatorix</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shivered; it felt as if spiders made of ice crystals were crawling up and down his spine. The size of the deception astounded him and left him feeling small, vulnerable. To cloud the minds of elves, dwarves, humans, and dragons alike, and without arousing the slightest hint of suspicion, was a feat so difficult, he doubted it could have been accomplished by a deliberate application of craft; rather, he believed it could only have been done by instinct, for such a spell would be far too complicated to put into words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He <span class="italic">had</span> to know who was responsible for manipulating the minds of everyone in Alagaësia, and why. If it was Galbatorix, then Eragon feared that Solembum was right and the Varden’s defeat was inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Do you think this was the work of dragons, as was the Banishing of the Names</span>? he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira was slow to answer. <span class="italic">Perhaps. But then, as Solembum said to you, there are many powers in Alagaësia. Until we go to Vroengard, we won’t know for certain one way or another</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If ever we do</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Aye</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon ran his fingers through his hair. He suddenly felt exceptionally tired. <span class="italic">Why does everything have to be so hard</span>? he wondered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Because</span>, said Saphira, <span class="italic">everyone wants to eat, but no one wants to be eaten</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He snorted, grimly amused.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Despite the speed with which he and Saphira could exchange thoughts, their conversation had lasted long enough for Arya and Glaedr to notice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why have you closed your minds to us?” asked Arya. Her gaze flicked toward one wall of the tent—the wall nearest to where Saphira lay curled in the darkness beyond. “Is something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You seem perturbed</span>, Glaedr added.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stifled a humorless chuckle. “Perhaps because I am.” Arya watched with concern as he went over to the cot and sat on the edge. He let his arms hang limp and heavy between his legs. He was silent for a moment as he made the shift from the language of his birth to that of the elves and magic, whereupon he said, “Do you trust Saphira and me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The resulting pause was gratifyingly brief.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I do,” replied Arya, also in the ancient language.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">As do I</span>, Glaedr likewise said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Shall I, or shall you</span>? Eragon quickly asked Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You want to tell them, so tell them</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked up at Arya. Then, still in the ancient language, he said to both her and Glaedr, “Solembum has told me the name of a place, a place on Vroengard, where Saphira and I may find some<span class="italic">one</span> or some<span class="italic">thing</span> to help us defeat Galbatorix. However, the name is enchanted. Every time I say the name, you soon forget it.” A faint expression of shock appeared on Arya’s face. “Do you believe me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I believe you,” Arya slowly said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I believe that</span> you <span class="italic">believe what you are saying</span>, Glaedr growled. <span class="italic">But that does not necessarily make it so</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How else can I prove it? You won’t remember if I tell you the name or share my memories with you. You could question Solembum, but again, what good would it do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What good? For one, we can prove that you haven’t been tricked or deceived by something that only appeared to be Solembum. And as for the spell, there may be a way to demonstrate its existence. Summon the werecat, and then we shall see what can be done</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Will you</span>? Eragon asked Saphira. He thought that the werecat would be more likely to come if Saphira asked him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A moment later, he felt her searching with her mind through the camp, and then he sensed the touch of Solembum’s consciousness against Saphira’s. After she and the werecat exchanged a brief, wordless communication, Saphira announced, <span class="italic">He is on his way</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They waited in silence, Eragon staring down at his hands as he compiled a list of supplies he would need for the trip to Vroengard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Solembum pushed aside the flaps to the tent and entered, Eragon was surprised to see that he was now in his human form: that of a young boy, dark-eyed and insolent. In his left hand, the werecat held a leg of roast goose, on which he was gnawing. A ring of grease coated his lips and chin, and drops of melted fat had splattered his bare chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he chewed on a strip of flesh, Solembum motioned with his sharp, pointed chin toward the patch of dirt where Glaedr’s heart of hearts lay buried. <span class="italic">What is it you want, firebreather</span>? he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">To know if you are who you seem to be!</span> said Glaedr, and the dragon’s consciousness seemed to surround Solembum’s, pressing inward like piles of black clouds around a brightly burning but wind-battered flame. The dragon’s strength was immense, and from personal experience, Eragon knew that few could hope to withstand him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a gargled yowl, Solembum spat out his mouthful of meat and sprang backward, as if he had stepped on a viper. He stood <span>where</span> he was, then, trembling with effort, his sharp teeth bared, and a look of such fury in his tawny eyes, Eragon placed his hand on the hilt of Brisingr as a precaution. The flame dimmed but held: a white-hot point of light amid a sea of churning thunderheads.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a minute, the storm diminished and the clouds withdrew, although they did not disappear entirely.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">My apologies, werecat</span>, said Glaedr, <span class="italic">but I had to know for certain</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum hissed, and the hair on his head fluffed and spiked so that it resembled the blossom of a thistle. <span class="italic">If you still had your body, old one, I would cut off your tail for that</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You, little cat? You could not have done more than scratch me</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again Solembum hissed, and then he turned on his heel and stalked toward the entrance, his shoulders hunched close to his ears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Wait</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">Did you tell Eragon about this place on Vroengard, this place of secrets that none can remember</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The werecat paused, and without turning around, he growled and brandished the goose leg over his head in an impatient, dismissive gesture. <span class="italic">I did</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And did you tell him the page in</span> Domia abr Wyrda <span class="italic">wherein he found the location of this place</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">So it seems, but I have no memory of it, and I hope that whatever is on Vroengard singes your whiskers and burns your paws</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The entrance to the tent made a loud flapping sound as Solembum swatted it aside; then his small form melted into the shadows, as if he had never existed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stood and, with the toe of his boot, pushed the scrap of half-eaten meat out of the tent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You should not have been so rough with him,” said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I had no other choice</span>, said Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Didn’t you? You could have asked his permission first.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And given him the opportunity to prepare? No. It is done; let it be, Arya</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I cannot. His pride is wounded. You should attempt to placate him. It would be dangerous to have a werecat as your enemy.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It is even more dangerous to have a dragon as your enemy. Let it be, elfling</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Troubled, Eragon exchanged looks with Arya. Glaedr’s tone bothered him—and her as well, he could see—but Eragon could not decide what to do about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Now, Eragon</span>, the golden dragon said, <span class="italic">will you allow me to examine the memories of your conversation with Solembum</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“If you want, but … why? You’ll only end up forgetting.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Perhaps. And then again, perhaps not. We shall see</span>. Addressing Arya, Glaedr said, <span class="italic">Separate your mind from ours, and do not allow Eragon’s memories to taint your consciousness</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“As you wish, Glaedr-elda.” As Arya spoke, the music of her thoughts grew ever more distant. A moment later, the eerie singing faded to silence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Glaedr returned his attention to Eragon. <span class="italic">Show me</span>, he commanded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Ignoring his trepidation, Eragon cast his mind back to when Solembum had first arrived at the tent, and he carefully recalled everything that had transpired between the two of them thereafter. Glaedr’s consciousness melded with Eragon’s so that the dragon could relive the experiences along with him. It was an unsettling sensation; it felt as if he and the dragon were two images stamped onto the same side of a coin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he finished, Glaedr withdrew somewhat from Eragon’s mind and then, to Arya, said, <span class="italic">When I have forgotten, if I do, repeat to me the words “Andumë and Fíronmas at the hill of sorrows, and their flesh like glass.” This place on Vroengard … I know of it. Or I once did. It was something of importance, something</span> … The dragon’s thoughts grayed for a second, as if a layer of mist had been blown over the hills and valleys of his being, obscuring them. <span class="italic">Well</span>? he demanded, regaining his former brusque attitude. <span class="italic">Why do we tarry? Eragon, show me your memories</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I already have.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even as Glaedr’s mood turned to disbelief, Arya said, “Glaedr, <span>remember</span>: ‘Andumë and Fíronmas at the hill of sorrows, and their flesh like glass.’”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">How</span>—Glaedr started, and then he growled with such force, Eragon almost expected to hear the sound out loud. <span class="italic">Argh. I hate spells that interfere with one’s memory. They’re the worst form of magic, always leading to chaos and confusion. Half the time they seem to end with family members killing one another without realizing it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What does the phrase you used mean</span>? Saphira asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Nothing, except to me and Oromis. But that was the point; no one would know of it unless I told them</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya sighed. “So the spell is real. I suppose you have to go to Vroengard, then. To ignore something of this importance would be folly. If nothing else, we need to know who the spider is at the center of this web.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I shall go as well</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">If someone means to harm you, they may not expect to fight two dragons instead of one. In any event, you will need a guide. Vroengard has become a dangerous place since the destruction of the Riders, and I would not have you fall prey to some forgotten evil</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hesitated as he noticed a strange yearning in Arya’s gaze, and he realized that she wanted to accompany them as well. “Saphira will fly faster if she only has to carry one person,” he said in a quiet voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know. … Only, I always wanted to visit the home of the Riders.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m sure you will. Someday.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded. “Someday.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon took a moment to marshal his energy and reflect on everything that needed to be done before he, Saphira, and Glaedr could leave. Then he drew a deep breath and rose from the cot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Captain Garven!” he called. “Will you please join us?”</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_91"></div></body>
