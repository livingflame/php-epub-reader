<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">“YOU’RE FINE,” SAID</span></span> Eragon, exasperated. “Stop worrying. There’s nothing you can do about it anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira growled and continued to study her image in the lake. She turned her head from side to side, then exhaled heavily, releasing a cloud of smoke that drifted out over the water like a small, lost thundercloud.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Are you sure</span>? she asked, and looked toward him. <span class="italic">What if it doesn’t grow back</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Dragons grow new scales all the time. You know that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, but I’ve never lost one before!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He did not bother to hide his smile; he knew she would sense his amusement. “You shouldn’t be so upset. It wasn’t very big.” Reaching out, he traced the diamond-shaped hole on the left side of her snout, where the object of her consternation had so recently been ensconced. The gap in her sparkling armor was no larger than the end of his thumb and about an inch deep. At the bottom of it, her leathery blue hide was visible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Curious, he touched her skin with the tip of his index finger. It felt warm and smooth, like the belly of a calf.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira snorted and pulled her head away from him. <span class="italic">Stop that; it tickles</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He chuckled and kicked at the water by the base of the rock he was sitting on, enjoying the sensation against the bottom of his bare feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It may not have been very big</span>, she said, <span class="italic">but everyone will notice that it’s missing. How could they not? One might as well overlook a bare patch of earth on the crest of a snow-covered mountain</span>. And her eyes rolled <span>forward</span> as she tried to peer down her long snout at the small, dark hole above her nostril.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon laughed and splashed a handful of water at her. Then, to soothe her injured pride, he said, “No one will notice, Saphira. Trust me. Besides, even if they do, they’ll take it for a battle wound and consider you all the more fearsome because of it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You think so</span>? She returned to examining herself in the lake. The water and her scales reflected off each other in a dazzling array of rainbow-hued flecks. <span class="italic">What if a soldier stabs me there? The blade would go right through me. Perhaps I should ask the dwarves to make a metal plate to cover the area until the scale regrows</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That would look exceedingly ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It would</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mm-hmm.” He nodded, on the verge of laughing again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She sniffed. <span class="italic">There’s no need to make fun of me. How would you like it if the fur on your head started falling out, or you lost one of those silly little nubs you call teeth? I would end up having to comfort you, no doubt</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No doubt,” he agreed easily. “But then, teeth don’t grow back.” He pushed himself off the rock and made his way up the shore to where he had left his boots, stepping carefully to avoid hurting his feet on the stones and branches that littered the water’s edge. Saphira followed him, the soft earth squishing between her talons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You could cast a spell to protect just that spot</span>, she said as he pulled on his boots.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I could. Do you want me to?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I do</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He worked out the enchantment in his head while he laced up his boots, then placed the palm of his right hand over the pit in her snout and murmured the necessary words in the ancient language. A faint azure glow emanated from underneath his hand as he bound the ward to her body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There,” he said when he finished. “Now you have nothing to worry about.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Except that I’m still missing a scale</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He gave her a push on the jaw. “Come on, you. Let’s go back to camp.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Together they left the lake and climbed the steep, crumbling bank behind them, Eragon using the exposed tree roots as handholds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the top of the rise, they had an unobstructed view of the Varden’s camp a half mile to the east, as well as, somewhat north of the camp, the sprawling mess of Dras-Leona. The only signs of life within the city were the tendrils of smoke that rose from the chimneys of many a house. As always, Thorn lay draped across the battlements above the southern gate, basking in the bright afternoon light. The red dragon looked asleep, but Eragon knew from experience that he was keeping a close eye on the Varden, and the moment anyone began to approach the city, he would rouse himself and issue a warning to Murtagh and the others inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hopped onto Saphira’s back, and she carried him to the camp at a leisurely pace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When they arrived, he slid to the ground and took the lead as they moved between the tents. The camp was quiet, and everything about it felt slow and sleepy, from the low, drawling tones of the warriors’ conversations to the pennants that hung motionless in the thick air. The only creatures who appeared immune to the general lethargy were the lean, half-feral dogs that ranged through the camp, constantly sniffing as they searched for discarded scraps of food. A number of the dogs bore scratches on their muzzles and flanks, the result of making the foolish, if understandable, mistake of thinking they could chase and torment a green-eyed werecat as they would any other cat. When it had happened, their yelps of pain had attracted the attention of the entire camp, and the men had laughed to see the dogs running away from the werecat with their tails between their legs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Conscious of the many looks he and Saphira attracted, Eragon kept his chin high and his shoulders square and adopted a vigorous stride in an attempt to convey an impression of purpose and <span>energy</span>. The men needed to see that he was still full of confidence, and that he had not allowed the tedium of their present predicament to weigh him down.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If only Murtagh and Thorn would leave</span>, thought Eragon. <span class="italic">They wouldn’t have to be gone for more than a day for us to capture the city</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So far, the siege of Dras-Leona had proven to be singularly uneventful. Nasuada refused to attack the city, for as she had said to Eragon, “You barely managed to best Murtagh the last time you met—do you forget how he stabbed you in the hip?—and he promised that he would be stronger still when you next crossed paths. Murtagh may be many things, but I am not inclined to believe he is a liar.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Strength isn’t everything when it comes to a fight between magicians,” Eragon had pointed out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, but it’s not unimportant either. Also, he now has the support of the priests of Helgrind, more than a few of whom I suspect are magicians. I won’t risk letting you face them and Murtagh head-on in battle, not even with Blödhgarm’s spellcasters by your side. Until we can contrive to lure Murtagh and Thorn away, or trap them, or otherwise gain an advantage over them, we stay here, and we don’t move against Dras-Leona.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon had protested, arguing that it was impractical to stall their invasion, and that if he could not defeat Murtagh, what hope did she think he would have against Galbatorix? But Nasuada had remained unconvinced.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They—along with Arya, Blödhgarm, and all the spellcasters of Du Vrangr Gata—had planned and plotted and searched for ways to gain the advantage Nasuada had spoken of. But every strategy they considered was flawed because it required more time and resources than were at the Varden’s disposal, or else because it ultimately failed to resolve the question of how to kill, capture, or drive off Murtagh and Thorn.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada had even gone to Elva and asked her if she would use her ability—which allowed her to sense other people’s pain, as well <span>as</span> any pain they were about to suffer in the immediate future—to overcome Murtagh or to surreptitiously gain entrance to the city. The silver-browed girl had laughed at Nasuada and sent her away with gibes and insults, saying, “I owe no bond of allegiance to you or anyone else, Nasuada. Find some other child to win your battles for you; I’ll not do it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And so, the Varden waited.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As day inexorably followed day, Eragon had watched the men grow sullen and discontent, and Nasuada had become increasingly worried. An army, Eragon had learned, was a ravenous, insatiable beast that would soon die and separate into its constituent elements unless massive amounts of food were shoveled into its many thousands of stomachs upon a regular basis. When marching into new territory, obtaining supplies for an army was a simple matter of confiscating food and other essentials from the people they conquered, and stripping resources from the surrounding countryside. Like a plague of locusts, the Varden left a barren swath of land in their wake, a swath devoid of most everything needed to support life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once they stopped moving, they soon exhausted the stores of food close at hand and were forced to subsist entirely on provisions brought to them from Surda and the several cities they had captured. Generous as the inhabitants of Surda were, and rich as the vanquished cities were, the regular deliveries of goods were not enough to sustain the Varden for much longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Though Eragon knew the warriors were devoted to their cause, he had no doubt that, when faced with the prospect of a slow, agonizing death by starvation that would accomplish nothing besides giving Galbatorix the satisfaction of gloating over their defeat, most men would elect to flee to some distant corner of Alagaësia, where they could live out the rest of their lives in safety from the Empire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">That moment had not yet arrived, but it was fast approaching.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Fear of that fate, Eragon was sure, was what had been keeping Nasuada up at night, so that she appeared increasingly haggard each morning, the bags under her eyes like small, sad smiles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The difficulties they had faced at Dras-Leona made Eragon grateful that Roran had avoided becoming similarly bogged down at Aroughs and heightened his admiration and appreciation for what his cousin had accomplished at the southern city. <span class="italic">He’s a braver man than I</span>. Nasuada would disapprove, but Eragon was determined that once Roran returned—which, if all went well, would be in just a few days—Eragon would once again provide him with a full set of wards. Eragon had already lost too many members of his family to the Empire and Galbatorix, and he was not about to let the same doom befall Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He paused to let a trio of arguing dwarves cross the path in front of him. The dwarves wore no helms or insignia, but he knew they were not of Dûrgrimst Ingeitum, for their plaited beards were trimmed with beads—a fashion he had never seen among the Ingeitum. Whatever the dwarves were quarreling about was a mystery to him—he could not understand more than a few words of their guttural language—but the topic was obviously of all-consuming importance, judging by their loud voices, unrestrained gestures, exaggerated expressions, and their failure to notice either him or Saphira standing in the path.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon smiled as they passed; he found their preoccupation somewhat comical, despite their evident seriousness. Much to the relief of everyone in the Varden, the dwarves’ army, led by their new king, Orik, had arrived at Dras-Leona two days before. That, and Roran’s victory at Aroughs, had since become the main topics of conversation throughout the camp. The dwarves nearly doubled the size of the Varden’s allied forces and would substantially increase the chances of the Varden reaching Urû’baen and Galbatorix if a favorable solution to the impasse with Murtagh and Thorn could be found.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he and Saphira walked through the camp, Eragon caught sight of Katrina sitting outside her tent, knitting clothes for her child-to-be. She greeted him with a raised hand and by calling, “Cousin!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He replied in kind, as had become their habit since her marriage.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After both he and Saphira enjoyed a leisurely lunch—which involved a fair amount of tearing and crunching on Saphira’s part—they retired to the patch of soft, sunlit grass next to Eragon’s tent. By order of Nasuada, the patch was always left open for Saphira’s use, a dictate that the Varden observed with religious zeal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There Saphira curled up to doze in the midday warmth, while Eragon fetched <span class="italic">Domia abr Wyrda</span> from his saddlebags, then climbed under the overhang of her left wing to nestle in the partially shaded hollow between the inner curve of her neck and her muscular foreleg. The light that shone through the folds of her wing, as well as that cast off in winking highlights from her scales, painted his skin a weird, purplish hue and covered the pages of the book with a smattering of glowing shapes that made it difficult to read the thin, angular runes. But he did not mind; the pleasure of sitting with Saphira more than made up for the inconvenience.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They sat together for an hour or two, until Saphira had digested her meal and Eragon was tired of deciphering the convoluted sentences of Heslant the Monk. Then, bored, they wandered through the camp, inspecting the defenses and occasionally exchanging words with the sentinels stationed along the perimeter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Near the eastern edge of the camp, where the bulk of the dwarves were situated, they came across a dwarf who was squatting next to a bucket of water, his sleeves rolled up past his elbows, molding a fist-sized ball of dirt with his hands. By his feet was a puddle of mud and a stick that had been used to stir it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sight was so incongruous, several moments elapsed before Eragon realized that the dwarf was Orik.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Derûndânn, Eragon … Saphira,” said Orik without looking up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Derûndânn,” said Eragon, repeating the traditional dwarvish greeting, and squatted on the other side of the puddle. He watched as Orik continued to refine the contours of the ball, smoothing and shaping it with the outer curve of his right thumb. Every so often, Orik reached down, grabbed a handful of dry dirt, and sprinkled it over the yellowish orb of earth, then gently brushed off the excess.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I never thought to see the king of the dwarves crouched on the ground, playing in the mud like a child,” Eragon said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik huffed, blowing out his mustache. “And I never thought to have a dragon and a Rider staring at me while I made an Erôthknurl.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And what is an Erôthknurl?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“A thardsvergûndnzmal.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“A <span class="italic">thardsver</span>—?” Eragon gave up halfway through the word, unable to remember the whole of it, much less pronounce it. “And that is …?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Something that appears to be other than what it actually is.” Orik raised the ball of dirt. “Like this. This is a stone fashioned from earth. Or, rather, so it shall seem when I am done.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“A stone from earth. … Is it magic?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, it is mine own skill. Nothing more.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Orik failed to explain further, Eragon asked, “How is it done?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“If you are patient, you will see.” Then, after a while, Orik relented and said, “First, you must find some dirt.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“A hard task, that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From under his bushy eyebrows, Orik gave him a look. “Some types of dirt are better than others. Sand, for example, will not work. The dirt must have particles of varying size, so that it will stick together properly. Also, it should have some clay in it, as this does. But most important, if I do this”—and he patted his hand against a bare strip of ground among the clumps of trampled grass—“there must be lots of dust in the dirt. See?” He held up his hand, showing Eragon the layer of fine powder that clung to his palm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why is that important?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah,” said Orik, and tapped the side of his nose, leaving behind a whitish smear. He resumed rubbing the sphere with his hands, turning it so that it would remain symmetrical. “Once you have good dirt, you wet it and you mix it like water and flour until you have a nice, thick mud.” He nodded at the pool by his feet. “From the mud, you form a ball, like so, eh? Then you squeeze it and wring out <span>every</span> drop you can. Then you make the ball perfectly round. When it begins to feel sticky, you do as I am doing: you pour dirt over it, to draw out more moisture from the interior. This you continue until the ball is dry enough to hold its shape, but not so dry that it cracks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mine Erôthknurl is almost to that point. When it gets there, I shall bear it to mine tent and leave it in the sun for a goodly while. The light and the warmth will draw out even more moisture from the center; then I shall again pour dirt over it and again clean it off. After three or four times, the outside of mine Erôthknurl should be as hard as the hide of a Nagra.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“All that just to have a ball of dry mud?” said Eragon, puzzled. Saphira shared his sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik scooped up another handful of dirt. “No, because that’s not the end of it. Next is when the dust becomes of use. I take it, and I smear the outside of the Erôthknurl with it, which forms a thin, smooth shell. Then I will let the ball rest and wait for more moisture to seep to the surface, then dust, then wait, then dust, then wait, and so on.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And how long will that take?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Until the dust no longer adheres to the Erôthknurl. The shell it forms is what gives an Erôthknurl its beauty. Over the course of a day, it will acquire a brilliant sheen, as if it were made of polished marble. With no buffing, no grinding, no magic—with only your heart, head, and hands—you will have made a stone out of common earth … a fragile stone, it is true, but a stone nevertheless.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Despite Orik’s insistence, Eragon still found it hard to believe that the mud at his feet could be transformed into anything like what Orik had described without the use of magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why are you making one, though, Orik dwarf king</span>? Saphira asked. <span class="italic">You must have many responsibilities now that you are ruler of your people</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik grunted. “I have nothing I must needs do at the moment. My men are ready for battle, but there is no battle for us to fight, and it would be bad for them if I were to fuss over them like a mother <span>hen</span>. Nor do I want to sit alone in my tent, watching mine beard grow. … Thus the Erôthknurl.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He fell silent then, but it seemed to Eragon that something was bothering Orik, so Eragon held his tongue and waited to see if Orik would say anything else. After a minute, Orik cleared his throat and said, “Used to be, I could drink and play dice with the others of mine clan, and it mattered not that I was Hrothgar’s adopted heir. We could still talk and laugh together without it feeling uncomfortable. I asked for no favors, nor did I show any. But now it is different. My friends cannot forget that I am their king, and I cannot ignore how their behavior has changed toward me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That is only to be expected,” Eragon pointed out. He empathized with Orik’s plight, for he had experienced much the same thing since becoming a Rider.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Perhaps. But knowing it makes it no easier to bear.” Orik made an exasperated sound. “Ach, life is a strange, cruel journey sometimes. … I admired Hrothgar as a king, but it often seemed to me that he was short with those he dealt with when he had no reason to be. Now I understand better why he was the way he was.” Orik cupped the ball of dirt with both hands and gazed at it, his brow knotted in a scowl. “When you met with Grimstborith Gannel in Tarnag, did he explain to you the significance of the Erôthknurln?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He never mentioned it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I suppose there were other matters that needed talking about. … Still, as one of the Ingeitum, and as an adopted knurla, you should know the import and symbology of the Erôthknurln. It is not just a way to focus the mind, pass the time, and create an interesting keepsake. No. The act of making a stone out of earth is a sacred one. By it, we reaffirm our faith in Helzvog’s power and offer tribute to him. One should approach the task with reverence and purpose. Crafting an Erôthknurl is a form of worship, and the gods do not look kindly on those who perform the rites in a frivolous manner. … From stone, flesh; from flesh, earth; and from earth, stone again. The wheel turns and we see but a glimpse of the entirety.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Only then did Eragon appreciate the depth of Orik’s disquiet. “You ought to have Hvedra with you,” he said. “She would keep you company and prevent you from becoming so grim. I’ve never seen you as happy as when you were with her at Bregan Hold.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The lines around Orik’s downcast eyes deepened as he smiled. “Aye. … But she is the grimstcarvlorss of the Ingeitum, and she cannot abandon her duties just to comfort me. Besides, I could not rest easy if she were within a hundred leagues of Murtagh and Thorn or, worse, Galbatorix and his accursed black dragon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In an attempt to cheer Orik up, Eragon said, “You remind me of the answer to a riddle: a dwarf king sitting on the ground, making a stone out of dirt. I’m not sure how the riddle itself would go, but perhaps, something along the lines of:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Strong and stout</span>,</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Thirteen stars upon his brow</span>,</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Living stone sat shaping dead earth into dead stone</span>.</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It doesn’t rhyme, but then, you can’t expect me to compose proper verse on the spur of the moment. I would imagine that a riddle like that would be quite a head-scratcher for most people.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Humph,” said Orik. “Not for a dwarf. Even our children could solve it quick as you please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">A dragon too</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I suppose you’re right,” said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he asked Orik about everything that had happened among the dwarves after he and Saphira had left Tronjheim for their second trip to the forest of the elves. Eragon had not had an opportunity to talk with Orik for any great length of time since the dwarves had arrived at Dras-Leona, and he was eager to hear how his friend had gotten along since assuming the throne.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik did not seem to mind explaining the intricacies of the dwarves’ politics. Indeed, as he spoke, his expression brightened and he became increasingly animated. He spent nearly an hour <span>recounting</span> the bickering and maneuvering that had gone on between the dwarf clans prior to assembling their army and marching to join the Varden. The clans were a fractious lot, as Eragon well knew, and even as king, Orik had difficulty commanding their obedience.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s like trying to herd a flock of geese,” said Orik. “They’re always trying to go off on their own, they make an obnoxious noise, and they’ll bite your hand first chance they get.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">During the course of Orik’s narration, Eragon thought to ask about Vermûnd. He had often wondered what had become of the dwarf chief who had plotted to assassinate him. He liked to know where his enemies were, especially one as dangerous as Vermûnd.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He returned to his home village of Feldarast,” Orik said. “There, by all accounts, he sits and drinks and rages about what is and what might have been. But none now listen to him. The knurlan of Az Sweldn rak Anhûin are proud and stubborn. In most cases, they would remain loyal to Vermûnd regardless of what the other clans might do or say, but attempting to kill a guest is an unforgivable offense. And not all of Az Sweldn rak Anhûin hate you like Vermûnd does. I cannot believe that they will agree to remain cut off from the rest of their kind just to protect a grimstborith who has lost every scrap of his honor. It may take years, but eventually they will turn against him. Already I have heard that many of the clan shun Vermûnd, even as they themselves are shunned.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What do you think will happen to him?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He will accept the inevitable and step down, or else one day someone will slip poison into his mead, or perhaps a dagger between his ribs. Either way, he is no longer a threat to you as the leader of Az Sweldn rak Anhûin.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They continued to talk until Orik had finished the first few stages of shaping his Erôthknurl and was ready to take the ball of dirt and set it to rest upon a piece of cloth by his tent to dry. As Orik rose to his feet and gathered up his bucket and stick, he said, “I appreciate you being so kind as to listen to me, Eragon. And you as <span>well</span>, Saphira. Strange as it may seem, you are the only ones besides Hvedra to whom I can talk freely. Everyone else …” He shrugged. “Bah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon got to his feet as well. “You’re our friend, Orik, whether you are king of the dwarves or not. We’re always happy to talk with you. And you know, you don’t have to worry about us telling others what you’ve said.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye, I know that, Eragon.” Orik squinted up at him. “You participate in the goings-on of the world, and yet you haven’t gotten caught up in all the petty scheming around you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It doesn’t interest me. Besides, there are more important things to deal with at the moment.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That’s good. A Rider should stand apart from everyone else. Otherwise, how can you judge things for yourself? I never used to appreciate the Riders’ independence, but now I do, if only for selfish reasons.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t stand entirely apart,” said Eragon. “I’m sworn both to you and to Nasuada.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik inclined his head. “True enough. But you are not fully part of the Varden—or the Ingeitum either, for that matter. Whatever the case may be, I’m glad I can trust you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A smile crept across Eragon’s face. “As am I.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“After all, we’re foster brothers, aren’t we? And brothers ought to watch each other’s backs.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">That they should</span>, thought Eragon, though he did not say it out loud. “Foster brothers,” he agreed, and clapped Orik on the shoulder.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_57"></div></body>
