<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">A WEEK PASSED:</span></span> a week of laughter and music and long walks amid the wonders of Ellesméra. Eragon took Roran, Katrina, and Ismira to visit Oromis’s hut on the Crags of Tel’naeír, and Saphira showed them the sculpture of licked stone she had made for the Blood-oath Celebration. As for Arya, she spent a day guiding them about the many gardens in the city, so they might see some of the more spectacular plants the elves had collected and created throughout the ages.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon and Saphira would have been happy to stay in Ellesméra for another few weeks, but Blödhgarm contacted them and informed them that he and the Eldunarí under his charge had arrived at Ardwen Lake. And though neither Eragon nor Saphira wished to admit it, they knew it was time to leave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It cheered them, however, when Arya and Fírnen announced that they would fly with them, at least until the edge of Du Weldenvarden and maybe a bit farther.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina decided to stay behind with Ismira, but Roran asked to accompany them on the first part of their journey, for as he said, “I’d like to see what the far side of Alagaësia looks like, and traveling with you is faster than having to ride all the way out there on a horse.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At dawn the next day, Eragon said his farewells to Katrina, who cried the whole while, and to Ismira, who nursed on her thumb and stared at him without comprehension.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then they set out, Saphira and Fírnen flying side by side as they headed eastward over the forest. Roran sat behind Eragon, holding <span>him</span> by the waist, while Cuaroc dangled from Saphira’s talons, his body reflecting the sunlight as brightly as any mirror.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">After two and a half days, they sighted Ardwen Lake: a pale sheet of water larger than the whole of Palancar Valley. On its western bank stood the city of Sílthrim, which neither Eragon nor Saphira had visited before. And bobbing in the water by the city’s wharves was a long white ship with a single mast.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The vessel looked as Eragon knew it would, for he recognized it from his dreams, and a sense of inexorable fate settled upon him as he gazed at it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">This was always meant to be</span>, he thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They spent the night in Sílthrim, which was much like Ellesméra, although smaller and more densely built. While they rested, the elves loaded the Eldunarí onto the ship, along with food, tools, cloth, and other useful supplies. The ship’s crew was composed of twenty elves who wished to help with the raising of the dragons and the training of future Riders, as well as Blödhgarm and all of his remaining spellcasters, save Laufin and Uthinarë, who at that point took their leave.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the morning, Eragon modified the spell that kept the eggs hidden above Saphira and removed two, which he gave to the elves Arya had chosen to safeguard them. One of the eggs would go to the dwarves, the other to the Urgals, and hopefully the dragons within would see fit to choose Riders from their designated race. If not, then they would swap places, and if they <span class="italic">still</span> did not find Riders for themselves … well, Eragon was not quite sure what to do then, but he was confident Arya would figure something out. Once the eggs hatched, they and their Riders would answer to Arya and Fírnen until they were old enough to join Eragon, Saphira, and the rest of their kin in the east.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon, Arya, Roran, Cuaroc, Blödhgarm, and the other elves traveling with them boarded the ship, and they set sail across the lake, while Saphira and Fírnen circled high overhead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The ship was named the <span class="italic">Talíta</span>, after a reddish star in the eastern sky. Light and narrow, the vessel needed only a few inches of water to float. It moved without sound and hardly needed steering, as it seemed to know exactly where its helmsman wished to go.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">For days, they floated through the forest, first across Ardwen Lake and then, later, down the Gaena River, which was swollen with the spring snowmelt. As they passed through the green tunnel of branches, birds of many kinds sang and flew about them, and squirrels—both red and black—would scold them from the tops of the trees or would sit watching on branches that hung just out of reach.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon spent most of his time with either Arya or Roran and only flew with Saphira on rare occasions. For her part, Saphira kept with Fírnen, and he often saw them sitting on the bank, their paws overlapping and their heads resting side by side on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">During the days, the light in the forest was gold and hazy; during the nights, the stars twinkled brightly and the waxing moon provided enough illumination to sail by. The warmth and the haze and the constant rocking of the <span class="italic">Talíta</span> made Eragon feel as if he were half-asleep, lost in the remembrance of a pleasant dream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eventually, as of course it had to, the forest ended, and they sailed out onto the fields beyond. The Gaena River turned south then and carried them alongside the forest to Eldor Lake, the waters of which were even larger than those of Ardwen Lake.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There the weather turned, and a storm sprang up. Tall waves pummeled the ship, and for a day, they were all miserable as a cold rain and a fierce wind battered them. The wind was at their back, however, and it sped their progress considerably.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From Eldor Lake, they entered onto the Edda River and sailed southward past the elven outpost of Ceris. After that, they left the forest behind entirely, and the <span class="italic">Talíta</span> glided on the river, across the plains, seemingly of its own volition.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From the moment they had emerged from within the trees, <span>Eragon</span> had expected Arya and Fírnen to leave. But neither said anything about departing, and Eragon was content not to ask them their plans.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Farther south they went, across more and more empty land. Looking about them, Roran said, “It’s rather desolate, isn’t it?” and Eragon had to agree.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last they arrived at the easternmost settlement in Alagaësia: a small, lonely collection of wooden buildings by the name of Hedarth. The dwarves had built the place for the sole purpose of trading with the elves, for there was nothing of value in the area save the herds of deer and wild oxen visible in the distance. The buildings stood at the juncture where the Âz Ragni poured into the Edda, more than doubling its size.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon, Arya, and Saphira had passed through Hedarth once before, in the opposite direction, when they had traveled from Farthen Dûr to Ellesméra after the battle with the Urgals. Thus Eragon knew what to expect when the village came into sight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">However, he was puzzled to see hundreds of dwarves waiting for them at the head of a makeshift pier that extended into the Edda. His confusion turned to delight when the group parted and Orik strode forth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Raising his hammer, Volund, over his head, Orik shouted, “You didn’t think I would let mine own foster brother leave without saying a proper goodbye, now did you?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Grinning, Eragon cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted back, “Never!”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">The elves docked the <span class="italic">Talíta</span> long enough for everyone to disembark, save Cuaroc, Blödhgarm, and two other elves who stayed to guard the Eldunarí. The water where the rivers met was too rough for the ship to hold its position without scraping against the pier, so the elves then cast off and sailed farther down the Edda, in search of a calmer place to lay anchor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The dwarves, Eragon was astounded to see, had brought to <span>Hedarth</span> four of the giant boars from the Beor Mountains. The Nagran were spitted on trees as thick as Eragon’s leg and were roasting over pits of glowing coals.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I killed that one myself,” Orik said proudly, pointing to the largest of the boars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Along with the rest of the feast, Orik had brought three wagons of the dwarves’ finest mead specifically for Saphira. Saphira hummed with pleasure when she saw the barrels. <span class="italic">You will have to try it as well</span>, she told Fírnen, who snorted and extended his neck, sniffing curiously at the barrels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When evening came and the food was cooked, they sat at the rough-hewn tables the dwarves had built just that day. Orik banged his hammer against his shield, silencing the crowd. Then he picked up a piece of meat, put it in his mouth, chewed, and swallowed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ilf gauhnith!” he proclaimed. The dwarves shouted with approval, and the feast began in earnest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the end of the evening, when everyone had eaten their fill—even the dragons—Orik clapped his hands and called for a servant who brought out a casket filled with gold and gems. “A small token of our friendship,” Orik said as he gave it to Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon bowed and thanked him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Orik went to Saphira and, with a twinkle in his eye, he presented her with a gold and silver ring that she might wear on any of the claws of her forefeet. “It is a special ring, for it will not scratch, nor will it stain, and as long as you wear it, your prey will not hear you approaching.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The gift pleased Saphira immensely. She had Orik place the ring on the middle talon of her right paw, and throughout the evening, Eragon caught her admiring the band of gleaming metal.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">At Orik’s insistence, they stayed the night in Hedarth. Eragon hoped to leave early the following morning, but as the sky began to brighten, Orik invited him, Arya, and Roran to breakfast. After breakfast, they fell to talking, and then they went to see the rafts <span>the</span> dwarves had used to float the Nagran from the Beor Mountains to Hedarth, and before long it was nearly dinnertime again, and Orik succeeded in convincing them to stay for one last meal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With the dinner, as with the feast the previous day, the dwarves provided song and music, and listening to the performance of a particularly skilled dwarf bard delayed the departure of their party even further.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Stay another night,” Orik urged. “It’s dark and no time for traveling.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon glanced up at the full moon and smiled. “You forget, it’s not so dark for me as it is for you. No, we must go. If we wait any longer, I fear we will never leave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then go with mine blessings, brother of mine heart.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They embraced, and then Orik had horses brought for them—horses the dwarves kept stabled in Hedarth for the elves who came to trade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon raised his arm in farewell to Orik. Then he spurred his steed forward and galloped with Roran and Arya and the rest of the elves away from Hedarth and down the game trail that ran along the southern bank of the Edda, where the air was sweet with the aroma of willows and cottonwoods. Above, the dragons followed, twining around each other in a playful, spiraling dance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Outside Hedarth, Eragon reined in his mount, as did the others, and they rode on at a slower, more comfortable pace, talking softly amongst themselves. Eragon discussed nothing of importance with Arya or Roran, nor they with him, for it was not the words that mattered but rather the sense of closeness they shared in the confines of the night. The mood between them felt precious and fragile, and when they spoke, it was with greater kindness than usual, for they knew their time together was drawing to an end, and none wished to mar it with a thoughtless phrase.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They soon arrived at the top of a small hill and gazed down from it upon the <span class="italic">Talíta</span>, which sat waiting for them on the far side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The ship appeared as Eragon knew it would. As it must.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">By the light of the pale moon, the vessel looked like a swan ready to take flight from the wide, slow-moving river and carry him into the vast unknown. The elves had lowered its sails, and the sheets of fabric gleamed with a faint sheen. A single figure stood at the tiller, but otherwise the deck was empty.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Past the <span class="italic">Talíta</span>, the flat, dark plain extended all the way to the distant horizon: a daunting expanse broken only by the river itself, which lay upon the land like a strip of hammered metal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A tightness formed in Eragon’s throat, and he pulled the hood of his cloak over his head, as if to hide himself from the sight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They slowly rode down the hill and through the whispering grass to the pebble beach by the ship. The hooves of the horses sounded sharp and loud against the stones.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There Eragon dismounted, as did the others. Unbidden, the elves formed two lines leading to the ship, one facing the other, and they planted the ends of their spears in the ground by their feet and stood thus, statue-like.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked them over, and the tightness in his throat increased, making it difficult to breathe properly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Now is the moment</span>, said Saphira, and he knew she was right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon untied the casket of gold and gems from the back of his horse’s saddle and carried it to Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This is where we part, then?” Roran asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded. “Here,” he said, giving the casket to Roran. “You should have this. You can make better use of it than I. … Use it to build your castle.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’ll do that,” said Roran, his voice thick. He placed the casket under his left arm, and then he embraced Eragon with his right, and they held each other for a long moment. Afterward, Roran said, “Be safe, Brother.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You too, Brother. … Take care of Katrina and Ismira.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I will.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Unable to think of anything else to say, Eragon touched Roran once more on the shoulder, then turned away and went to join Arya where she stood waiting for him by the two rows of elves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They stared at each other for a handful of heartbeats, and then Arya said, “Eragon.” She had drawn her cowl as well, and in the moonlight, he could see little of her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Arya.” He looked down the silvery river and then back at Arya, and he gripped the hilt of Brisingr. He was so full of emotion, he trembled. He did not want to leave, but he knew he must. “Stay with me—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her gaze darted up. “I cannot.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“… stay with me until the first curve in the river.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She hesitated, then nodded. He held out his arm, and she looped hers through his, and together they walked onto the ship and went to stand by the prow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elves behind them followed, and once they were all on board, they pulled up the gangplank. Without wind or oars, the ship moved away from the stony shore and began to drift down the long, flat river.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On the beach, Roran stood alone, watching them go. Then he threw back his head and uttered a long, aching cry, and the night echoed with the sound of his loss.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For several minutes, Eragon stood next to Arya, and neither spoke as they watched the first curve in the river approach. At last, Eragon turned to her, and he pushed the cowl away from her face, so that he could see her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Arya,” he said. And he whispered her true name. A tremor of recognition ran through her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She whispered his true name in response, and he too shivered at hearing the fullness of his being.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He opened his mouth to speak again, but Arya forestalled him by placing three of her fingers upon his lips. She stepped back from him then and raised one arm over her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Farewell, Eragon Shadeslayer,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And then Fírnen swept down from above and snatched her off the deck of the ship, buffeting Eragon with the gusts of air from his wings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Farewell,” Eragon whispered as he watched her and Fírnen fly back toward where Roran still stood upon the distant shore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon finally allowed the tears to spill from his eyes, and he clutched the railing of the ship and wept as he left behind all that he had ever known. Above, Saphira keened, and her grief mingled with his as they mourned what could never be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In time, however, Eragon’s heart slowed, and his tears dried, and a measure of peace stole over him as he gazed out at the empty plain. He wondered what strange things they might encounter within its wild reaches, and he pondered the life he and Saphira were to have—a life with the dragons and Riders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We are not alone, little one</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A smile crept across his face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And the ship sailed onward, gliding serenely down the moonlit river toward the dark lands beyond.</span></p><div class="calibre3"> </div>
