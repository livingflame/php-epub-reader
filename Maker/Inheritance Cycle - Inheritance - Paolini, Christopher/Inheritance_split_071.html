<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ALONG WITH THE</span></span> warriors of his battalion, Roran fought his way down off Urû’baen’s outer wall to the streets below. There they paused to regroup; then he shouted, “To the gate!” and pointed with his hammer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and several men from Carvahall, including Horst and Delwin, took the lead as they trotted along the inside of the wall toward the breach the elves had created with their magic. Arrows flitted over their heads as they ran, but none were aimed at them specifically, and he did not hear any of their group take a wound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They encountered dozens of soldiers in the narrow space between the wall and the stone houses. A few paused to fight, but the rest ran, and even those who fought soon retreated down the adjoining alleyways.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At first the savage intensity of slaughter and victory blinded Roran to all else. But when the soldiers they met continued to flee, a sense of unease began to gnaw at his stomach, and he began to look around with greater alertness, searching for anything that seemed different from what it ought to be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Something was wrong. He was sure of it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Galbatorix wouldn’t let them give up this easily,” he muttered to himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What?” asked Albriech, who was next to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I said, Galbatorix wouldn’t let them give up this easily.” Twisting his head around, Roran shouted to the rest of the battalion, “Pin back your ears and look sharp! Galbatorix has a surprise or two in store for us, I wager. We won’t let ourselves get caught unawares, though, now will we?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Stronghammer!” they shouted in return, and pounded their weapons against their shields. All but the elves, that was. Satisfied, he quickened the pace even as he continued to scan the rooftops.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They soon broke out into the rubble-strewn street that led to what had once been the main gate of the city. Now all that was left was a gaping hole several hundred feet wide at the top, with a pile of broken stones at the bottom. Through the gap streamed the Varden and their allies: men, dwarves, Urgals, elves, and werecats, fighting alongside one another for the first time in history.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arrows rained down on the army as it poured into the city, but the elves’ magic stopped the deadly darts before they could cause harm. The same did not hold true for Galbatorix’s soldiers; Roran saw a number of them fall to the Varden’s archers, although some appeared to have wards that protected them from the arrows. Galbatorix’s favorites, he assumed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As his battalion joined the rest of the army, Roran spotted Jörmundur riding in the press of warriors. Roran called out greetings, and Jörmundur replied in kind and shouted, “Once we reach that fountain”—he pointed with his sword toward a large, ornate edifice that stood in a courtyard several hundred yards in front of them—“take your men and head off to the right. Clear the southern part of the city, then meet back up with us at the citadel.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran nodded, exaggerating the movement so Jörmundur could see. “Sir!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He felt safer now that they had the company of other warriors, but still his sense of unease continued. <span class="italic">Where are they</span>? he wondered, looking at the mouths of the empty streets. Galbatorix had supposedly gathered the whole of his army in Urû’baen, but Roran had yet to see evidence of a large force of men. There had been surprisingly few soldiers on the walls, and those who were present had fled far sooner than they should have.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">He’s luring us in</span>, Roran realized with sudden certainty. <span class="italic">It’s all a play designed to trick us</span>. Catching Jörmundur’s attention again, he shouted, “Something’s wrong! Where are the soldiers?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Jörmundur frowned and turned to speak with King Orrin and Queen Islanzadí, who had ridden up to him. Oddly enough, a white raven sat on Islanzadí’s left shoulder, his claws hooked into her corselet of golden armor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And still the Varden continued to march deeper and deeper into Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What is the matter, Stronghammer?” growled Nar Garzhvog as he pushed his way over to Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran glanced up at the heavy-headed Kull. “I’m not sure. Galbatorix—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He forgot whatever else he was going to say when a horn sounded among the buildings ahead of them. It blared for the better part of a minute, a low, ominous tone that caused the Varden to pause and look around with concern.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran’s heart sank. “This is it,” he said to Albriech. Turning, he waved his hammer, motioning toward the side of the street. “Move over!” he bellowed. “Get between the buildings and take cover!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took his battalion longer to extricate itself from the column of warriors than it had to join it. Frustrated, Roran continued shouting, trying to get them to move faster. “Quickly, you sorry dogs! Quickly!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The horn sounded again, and Jörmundur finally called a halt to the army.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">By then, Roran’s warriors were safely wedged into three streets, where they stood clustered behind buildings, waiting for his orders. He stood by the side of a house, along with Garzhvog and Horst, peering around the corner as he tried to see what was happening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once more the horn sounded, and then the tramp of many feet echoed through Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Dread crawled through Roran as he saw rank after rank of soldiers march into the streets leading from the citadel, the rows of men brisk and orderly, their faces devoid of even the slightest hint of fear. At their head rode a squat, broad-shouldered man upon a gray charger. He wore a gleaming breastplate that bulged over a foot <span>outward</span>, as if to accommodate a large belly. In his left hand, he carried a shield painted with the device of a crumbling tower upon a bare stone peak. In his right hand, he carried a spiked mace that most men would have found difficult to lift but that he swung back and forth with ease.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran wet his lips. He guessed that the man was none other than Lord Barst, and if even half the things he had heard about the man were true, then Barst would never ride straight at an opposing force unless he was utterly certain of destroying it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran had seen enough. Pushing himself off the corner of the building, he said, “We’re not going to wait. Tell the others to follow us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You mean to run away, Stronghammer?” rumbled Nar Garzhvog.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Roran. “I mean to attack from the side. Only a fool would attack an army like that head-on. Now go!” He gave the Urgal a shove, then hurried down the cross street to take his position at the front of his warriors. <span class="italic">And only a fool would go head to head with the man Galbatorix has chosen to lead his forces</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they made their way between the densely packed buildings, Roran heard the soldiers start to chant, “Lord Barst! Lord Barst! Lord Barst!” And they stamped the ground with their hobnail boots and banged their swords against their shields.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Better and better</span>, Roran thought, wishing he were anywhere but there.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the Varden shouted in return, the air filled with cries of “Eragon!” and “The Riders!” and the city rang with the sounds of clashing metal and the screams of wounded men.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When his battalion was level with what Roran guessed was the midpoint of the Empire’s army, he had them turn and start in the direction of their enemies. “Stay together,” he ordered. “Form a wall with your shields, and whatever you do, make sure you protect the spellcasters.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They soon spotted the soldiers in the street—spearmen, mostly—<span>pressed</span> close against one another as they shuffled toward the front of the battle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nar Garzhvog let out a ferocious bellow, as did Roran and the other warriors in the battalion, and they charged toward the ranks of men. The soldiers shouted with alarm, and panic spread among them as they scrambled backward, trampling their own kind as they tried to find room to fight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Howling, Roran fell upon the first row of men. Blood sprayed around him as he swung his hammer and felt metal and bone give way. The soldiers were so tightly packed that they were nearly helpless. He killed four of them before even one managed to swing a sword at him, which he blocked with his shield.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">By the edge of the street, Nar Garzhvog knocked down six men with a single blow of his club. The soldiers started to climb back to their feet, ignoring injuries that would have crippled them had they been able to feel pain, and Garzhvog struck again, pounding them to a pulp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran was aware of nothing but the men in front of him, the weight of his hammer in his hand, and the slipperiness of the blood-coated cobblestones under his feet. He broke and he battered; he ducked and he shoved; he growled and he shouted and he killed and he killed and he killed—until, to his surprise, he swung his hammer and found nothing but empty air before him. His weapon bounced against the ground, striking sparks from the cobblestones, and a painful jolt ran up his arm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran shook his head, his battle rage clearing; he had fought his way completely through the mass of soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Spinning around, he saw that most of his warriors were still engaged with soldiers to his right and left. Loosing another howl, he dove back into the fray.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Three soldiers closed in on him: two with spears, one with a sword. Roran lunged at the man with the sword, but his foot slipped beneath him as he stepped on something soft and wet. Even as he <span>fell</span>, he swung his hammer at the ankles of the nearest man. The soldier danced back and was about to bring his sword down on Roran when an elf leaped forward and, with two quick strokes, beheaded all three soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was the same elf woman he had spoken to outside the city walls, only now splattered with stripes of gore. Before he could thank her, she darted past, her sword a blur as she cut down more of the soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After watching them in action, Roran decided that each elf was worth at least five men, not even counting their ability to cast spells. As for the Urgals, he just did his best to stay out of their way, especially the Kull. They seemed to make little distinction between friend and foe once roused, and the Kull were so big, it was easy for them to kill someone without meaning to. He saw one of them crush a soldier between his leg and the side of a building and not even notice. Another time, he saw a Kull behead a soldier with an inadvertent swipe of a shield while turning about.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The fighting continued for another few minutes, whereupon the only soldiers remaining in the area were dead soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Wiping the sweat from his brow, Roran glanced up and down the street. Farther into the city, he saw remnants of the force they had destroyed disappearing between the houses as the men ran to join another part of Galbatorix’s army. He considered pursuing them, but the main battle lay closer to the edge of the city, and he wanted to fall upon the rear of the attacking soldiers and disrupt their lines.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This way!” he shouted, raising his hammer and starting down the street.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">An arrow buried itself in the edge of his shield, and he looked up to see the silhouette of a man sliding below the peak of a nearby roof.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Roran emerged from between the close-set buildings into the open area before the remnants of Urû’baen’s front gate, he found a scene of such confusion that he hesitated, unsure of what to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The two armies had mingled together until it was impossible to determine lines or ranks or even where the front of the battle was. The crimson tunics of the soldiers were scattered throughout the square, sometimes singly, sometimes in large clusters, and the fighting had spilled into all of the nearby streets, the armies spreading outward like a stain. Among the combatants Roran expected to see, he also spotted scores of cats—ordinary cats, not werecats—attacking the soldiers, as savage and frightening a sight as he had ever beheld. The cats, he knew, followed the direction of the werecats.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And in the center of the square, sitting upon his gray charger, was Lord Barst, his large round breastplate gleaming with the light of the fires burning in nearby houses. He swung his mace again and again, faster than any human ought to have been able to, and with every blow he slew at least one of the Varden. Arrows fired at him vanished in puffs of sickly orange flame, swords and spears bounced off him as if he were made of stone, and even the strength of a charging Kull was not enough to knock him off his steed. Roran watched with astonishment as, with a casual swipe of his mace, the armor-clad man brained an attacking Kull, breaking his horns and skull as easily as an eggshell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran frowned. <span class="italic">How can he be so strong and fast</span>? Magic was the obvious answer, but that magic had to have a source. There were no gems upon Barst’s mace or armor, nor could Roran believe that Galbatorix would be feeding energy to Barst from a distance. Roran remembered his conversation with Eragon the night before they rescued Katrina from Helgrind. Eragon had told him that it was basically impossible to alter a human’s body to have the speed and strength of an elf, even if the human was a Rider—which made what the dragons had done to Eragon during the Blood-oath Celebration all the more amazing. It seemed unlikely that Galbatorix could have managed a similar transformation with Barst, which again made Roran wonder, where was the source of Barst’s unnatural might?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Barst pulled on the reins of his steed, turning the horse around. The light moving across the surface of his swollen breastplate caught Roran’s attention.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran’s mouth went dry, and he felt a sense of despair. From what he knew, Barst was not the sort of man to have a belly. He would not let himself go soft, nor would Galbatorix have chosen such a man to defend Urû’baen. The only explanation that made sense, then, was that Barst had an Eldunarí strapped to his body underneath his oddly shaped breastplate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the street shook and split, and a dark crevice appeared beneath Barst and his charger. The hole would have swallowed them both, with room to spare, but the horse remained standing upon thin air, as if its hooves were still planted firmly upon the ground. A wreath of different colors flickered around Barst, like a nimbus of tattered rainbows. Alternating waves of heat and cold emanated from his location, and Roran saw tendrils of ice crawling up from the ground, seeking to wrap themselves around the horse’s legs and hold them in place. But the ice could not grip the horse, nor did any of the magic seem to have an effect on either the man or the animal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Barst pulled on the reins again, then spurred his horse toward a group of elves who stood beside a nearby house, chanting in the ancient language. It was they, Roran assumed, who had been casting the spells against Barst.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Lifting his mace above his head, Barst charged into the midst of the elves. They scattered, seeking to defend themselves, but to no avail, for Barst split their shields and broke their swords, and when he struck, the mace crushed the elves as if their bones were as thin and hollow as those of birds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why didn’t their wards protect them</span>? Roran wondered. <span class="italic">Why can’t they stop him with their minds? He’s only one man, and there’s only one Eldunarí with him</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A few yards away, a large round stone crashed into the sea of struggling bodies, leaving behind a bright red smear, and bounced <span>into</span> the front of a building, where it shattered the statues above the doorframe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran ducked and cursed as he looked for where the stone had come from. Halfway across the city, he saw that Galbatorix’s soldiers had retaken the catapults and other war machines mounted on the curtain wall. <span class="italic">They’re firing into their own city</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">They’re firing at their own men!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a growl of disgust, he turned away from the square, so that he was facing the interior of the city. “We can’t help here!” he shouted to the battalion. “Leave Barst to the others. Take the street over there!” He pointed to his left. “We’ll fight our way to the wall and make our stand there!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">If the warriors responded, he did not hear, for he was already moving. Behind him, another stone crashed into the fighting armies, causing even more screams of pain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The street Roran had chosen was full of soldiers, as well as a few elves and werecats, who were clumped together by the front door of a hatter’s shop, hard-pressed to fend off the large number of enemies around them. The elves shouted something, and a dozen soldiers fell to the ground, but the rest remained standing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Diving into the midst of the soldiers, Roran again lost himself in the red-tinged haze of battle. He leaped over one of the fallen soldiers and brought his hammer down on the helm of a man with his back turned. Confident that the man was dead, Roran used his shield to shove the next soldier back and then jabbed with the end of his hammer at the man’s throat, crushing it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Next to him, Delwin caught a spear in his shoulder and went down on one knee with a cry of pain. Swinging his hammer even faster than normal, Roran drove back the spearman while Delwin pulled the weapon out and got back to his feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Fall back,” Roran told him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Delwin shook his head, teeth bared. “No!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Fall back, blast you! That’s an order.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Delwin cursed, but he obeyed, and Horst took his place. The <span>smith</span>, Roran noticed, was bleeding from cuts on his arms and legs, but they did not seem to interfere with his ability to move.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Evading a sword thrust, Roran took a step forward. He seemed to hear a faint rushing sound behind him, and then a thunderclap went off in his ears, and the earth spun around him and everything went black.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">He woke with a throbbing head. Above, he saw the sky—bright now with light from the rising sun—and the dark underside of the crevice-lined overhang.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Groaning with pain, he pushed himself upright. He was lying at the base of the city’s outer wall, next to the bloody fragments of a stone from a catapult. His shield was missing, as was his hammer, which concerned him in a befuddled sort of way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even as he tried to regain his bearings, a group of five soldiers rushed at him, and one of the men stabbed him in the chest with a spear. The point of the weapon drove him back against the wall, but it did not pierce his skin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Grab him!” shouted the soldiers, and Roran felt hands take hold of his arms and legs. He thrashed, trying to wrench free, but he was still weak and disoriented, and there were too many soldiers for him to overpower.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The soldiers struck at him again and again, and he felt his strength fading as his wards shielded him from the blows. The world grew gray, and he was about to lose consciousness again when the blade of a sword sprouted from the mouth of one of the soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The soldiers dropped him, and Roran saw a dark-haired woman whirling among them, swinging her sword with the practiced ease of a seasoned warrior. Within seconds, she killed the five men, although one of them managed to give her a shallow cut along her left thigh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Afterward, she offered him her hand and said, “Stronghammer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he grasped her forearm, he saw that her wrist—where her worn bracer did not cover it—was layered with scars, as if she had <span>been</span> burned or whipped nearly to the bone. Behind the woman stood a pale-faced teenage girl clad in a piecemeal collection of armor, and also a boy who looked a year or two younger than the girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Who are you?” he asked, standing. The woman’s face was striking: broad and strong-boned, with the bronzed, weather-beaten look of one who had spent most of her life outdoors.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“A passing stranger,” she said. Bending at the knees, she picked up one of the soldiers’ spears and handed it to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“My thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded, and then she and her young companions trotted off among the buildings, heading farther into the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran stared after them for a half second, wondering, then shook himself and hurried back along the street to rejoin his battalion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The warriors greeted him with shouts of astonishment and, heartened, attacked the soldiers with renewed vigor. However, as Roran took his place along with the other men from Carvahall, he discovered that the stone that had struck him had also killed Delwin. His sorrow quickly turned to rage, and he fought with even greater ferocity than before, determined to help end the battle as soon as possible.</span></p>
