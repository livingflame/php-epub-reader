<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">DARKNESS, AND IN</span></span> that darkness, silence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon felt himself slide to a stop, then … nothing. He could breathe, but the air was stale and lifeless, and when he tried to move, the strain upon his spell increased.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He touched the minds of everyone around him, checking that he had managed to save them all. Elva was unconscious, and Murtagh nearly so, but they were alive, as were the rest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was the first time Eragon had come into contact with Thorn’s mind. As he did, the red dragon seemed to recoil. His thoughts felt darker, more contorted than Saphira’s, but there was a strength and nobility to him that impressed Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We cannot maintain this spell for much longer</span>, said Umaroth, his voice tense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You have to</span>, said Eragon. <span class="italic">If you don’t, we’ll die</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Seconds more passed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without warning, light flooded Eragon’s eyes, and an onslaught of noise assailed his ears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He winced and blinked while his eyes adjusted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Through the smoke-filled air, he saw a huge glowing crater where Galbatorix had been standing. The incandescent stone pulsed like living flesh as breaths of air wafted over its surface. The ceiling glowed as well, and the sight unnerved Eragon; it was as if they were standing inside a giant crucible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The air smelled like the taste of iron.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The walls of the room were cracked, and the pillars, carvings, and lanterns had been pulverized. At the back of the chamber lay Shruikan’s corpse, much of the flesh stripped from his soot-blackened <span>bones</span>. At the front, the explosion had shattered the stone walls, as well as the walls beyond for hundreds of feet, exposing a veritable warren of tunnels and rooms. The beautiful golden doors that had guarded the entrance to the chamber had been blown off their hinges, and Eragon thought he glimpsed daylight at the far end of the quarter-mile-long hallway that led to the outside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he got to his feet, he noticed that his ward was still drawing strength from the dragons, but not so quickly as before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A piece of stone the size of a house fell from the ceiling and landed next to Shruikan’s skull, where it split into a dozen pieces. Around them, more cracks spread through the walls, ominous shrieks and groans sounding from every side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya went to the two children, grabbed the boy around his waist, and climbed with him up onto Saphira’s back. Once there, she pointed at the girl and said to Eragon, “Throw her to me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon lost a second as he struggled to sheathe Brisingr. Then he grabbed the girl and tossed her to Arya, who caught her in outstretched arms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon turned and sidestepped Elva as he hurried over to Nasuada. “Jierda!” he said, placing a hand on the manacles that held her to the block of gray stone. The spell had no apparent effect, so he ended it quickly before it consumed too much energy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada made an urgent sound, and he pulled the knotted cloth out of her mouth. “You have to find the key!” she said. “Galbatorix’s jailer has it on him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We’ll never find him in time!” Eragon drew Brisingr again and swung at the chain connected to the manacle around her left hand. The sword bounced off the links with a harsh reverberation, leaving not so much as a scratch on the dull metal. He swung a second time, but the chain was impervious to his blade.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Another piece of rock fell from the ceiling and struck the floor with a loud <span class="italic">crack</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A hand gripped his arm, and he turned to see Murtagh standing <span>behind</span> him, one arm pressed against the wound in his stomach. “Move aside,” he growled. Eragon did, and Murtagh spoke the name of all names, as he had before, as well as <span class="italic">jierda</span>, and the iron cuffs opened and fell from Nasuada’s limbs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh took her by the wrist, and he began to lead her toward Thorn. After his first step, she slipped under his arm and allowed him to lean his weight on her shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon opened his mouth, then closed it. He would ask his questions later.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Wait!” cried Arya, and she leaped down from Saphira and ran over to Murtagh. “Where is the egg? And the Eldunarí? We can’t leave them!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh frowned, and Eragon felt the information pass between him and Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya spun around, her burnt hair flying, and sprinted toward a doorway on the opposite side of the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s too dangerous!” Eragon shouted after her. “This place is falling apart! Arya!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Go</span>, she said. <span class="italic">Get the children to safety. Go! You haven’t much time!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon cursed. At the very least, he wished she had taken Glaedr with her. He slid Brisingr back into its scabbard, then bent and picked up Elva, who was just beginning to stir.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What’s happening?” she asked as Eragon carried her up onto Saphira’s back behind the two other children.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We’re leaving,” he said. “Hold on.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira had already started moving. Limping because of her wounded foreleg, she trotted around the crater. Thorn followed close behind her, Murtagh and Nasuada upon his back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Look out!” shouted Eragon as he saw a chunk of the glowing ceiling break loose directly overhead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira shied to her left, and the jagged piece of stone landed next to her and sent a burst of straw-yellow shards in every direction. One of them struck Eragon in the side and lodged in his mail. <span>He</span> plucked it out and threw it away. Smoke trailed from the fingers of his gloves, and he smelled burnt leather. More pieces of stone fell elsewhere in the chamber.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Saphira arrived at the mouth of the hallway, Eragon twisted and looked back at Murtagh. “What of the traps?” he shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh shook his head and waved for them to continue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Piles of broken stone covered the floor along much of the hallway, which slowed the dragons. To either side, Eragon could see into the rubble-filled rooms and tunnels that the explosion had torn open. Within them, tables, chairs, and other pieces of furniture burned. The limbs of the dead and dying stuck out at odd angles from beneath the tumbled stones, occasionally a grimy face or the back of a head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He looked for Blödhgarm and his spellcasters but saw no sign of them, either dead or alive.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Farther down the hallway, hundreds of people—soldiers and servants alike—poured out of the adjoining doorways and ran toward the now-gaping entrance. Broken limbs were common among them, as were burns, scrapes, and other wounds. The survivors moved aside for Saphira and Thorn, but otherwise ignored the dragons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira was nearly at the end of the hall when a thunderous crash sounded behind them, and Eragon looked back to see that the throne room had caved in on itself, burying the chamber floor under a pile of stone fifty feet thick.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Arya!</span> thought Eragon. He tried to find her with his mind, but without success. Either too much material separated them, or one of the spells woven throughout the mined-out crag blocked his mental probe, or—the one alternative he hated to consider—she was dead. She had not been in the room when it collapsed; that much he knew, but he wondered if she would be able to find her way back out again, now that the throne room was blocked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they emerged from the citadel, the air cleared and Eragon was able to see the destruction that the blast had wreaked on Urû’baen. It had ripped off the slate roofs of many nearby buildings and set fire <span>to</span> the beams underneath. Scores of fires dotted the rest of the city. The threads and plumes of smoke drifted upward until they collided with the underside of the shelf above. There they pooled and flowed along the angled surface of the stone, like water over a streambed. By the southeastern edge of the city, the smoke caught the light of the morning sun as it seeped around the side of the overhang, and there the smoke glowed with the reddish-orange color of a fire opal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The people of Urû’baen were fleeing their houses, streaming through the streets toward the hole in the outer wall. The soldiers and servants from the citadel hurried to join them, giving Saphira and Thorn a wide berth as they ran across the courtyard in front of the fortress. Eragon paid them little attention; as long as they remained peaceful, he did not care what they did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira stopped in the middle of the quadrangle, and Eragon lowered Elva and the two nameless children to the ground. “Do you know where your parents are?” he asked, kneeling by the siblings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They nodded, and the boy pointed toward a large house on the left side of the courtyard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Is that where you live?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The boy nodded again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Go on, then,” said Eragon, and gave them a gentle push on the back. Without further prompting, the brother and sister ran across the courtyard to the building. The door to the house flew open, and a balding man with a sword at his belt stepped out and wrapped the two of them in his arms. He gave Eragon a glance, then hurried the children inside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">That was easy</span>, Eragon said to Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Galbatorix must have had his men find the nearest hatchlings</span>, she replied. <span class="italic">We didn’t give him time to do much else</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I suppose</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Thorn sat a number of yards away from Saphira, and Nasuada helped Murtagh down from his back. Then Murtagh slumped against Thorn’s belly. Eragon heard him begin to recite spells of healing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon likewise attended to Saphira’s wounds, ignoring his own, <span>for</span> hers were more serious. The gash on her left foreleg was as wide as both his hands put together, and a pool of blood was forming about her foot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Tooth or claw</span>? he asked as he examined the wound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Claw</span>, she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He used her strength, as well as Glaedr’s, to mend the gash. When he finished, he turned his attention to his own wounds, starting with the burning line of pain in his side, where Murtagh had stabbed him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he worked, he kept an eye on Murtagh—watched as Murtagh healed his gut wound, Thorn’s broken wing, and the dragon’s other injuries. Nasuada stayed by him the whole while, her hand on his shoulder. He had, Eragon saw, somehow reacquired Zar’roc on the way out of the throne room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon then turned to Elva, who was standing nearby. She appeared pained, but he saw no blood upon her. “Are you hurt?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her brow furrowed, and she shook her head. “No, but many of them are.” And she pointed at the people fleeing the citadel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mmh.” Eragon glanced over at Murtagh again. He and Nasuada were standing now, talking to each other.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada frowned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Murtagh reached out, grasped the neck of her tunic, and pulled it to the side, tearing the fabric.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon had drawn Brisingr halfway out of its sheath before he saw the map of angry-looking welts below Nasuada’s collarbone. The sight struck him like a blow; it reminded him of the wounds on Arya’s back after he and Murtagh had rescued her from Gil’ead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada nodded and bowed her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again Murtagh began to speak, this time, Eragon was sure, in the ancient language. He placed his hands upon various parts of Nasuada’s body, his touch gentle—even hesitant—and her expression of relief was all the evidence Eragon needed to understand how much pain she had been suffering.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon watched for a minute longer, then a sudden rush of emotion swept through him. His knees grew weak, and he sat on Saphira’s right paw. She lowered her head and nuzzled his shoulder, and he leaned his head against her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We did it</span>, she said in a quiet tone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We did it</span>, he said, hardly able to believe the words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He could feel Saphira thinking about Shruikan’s death; as dangerous as Shruikan had been, she still mourned the passing of one of the last remaining members of her race.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon gripped her scales. He felt light, almost dizzy, as if he might float away from the surface of the earth. <span class="italic">What now …</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Now we will rebuild</span>, said Glaedr. His own emotions were a curious mixture of satisfaction, grief, and weariness. <span class="italic">You acquitted yourself well, Eragon. No one else would have thought to attack Galbatorix as you did</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I just wanted him to understand,” he murmured wearily. But if Glaedr heard, he chose not to respond.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">At last, the Oath-breaker is dead</span>, crowed Umaroth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It seemed impossible that Galbatorix was no more. As Eragon contemplated the fact, something within his mind seemed to release, and he remembered—as if he had never forgotten—everything that had transpired during their time in the Vault of Souls.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A tingle passed through him. <span class="italic">Saphira</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I know</span>, she said, her excitement rising. <span class="italic">The eggs!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon smiled. Eggs! Dragon eggs! As a race, they would not pass into the void. They would survive, and flourish, and return to their former glory, as they had been before the fall of the Riders.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then a horrible suspicion occurred to him. <span class="italic">Did you make us forget anything else</span>? he asked Umaroth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If we did, how would we know</span>? replied the white dragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Look!” cried Elva, pointing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon turned and saw Arya walking out of the dark maw of the citadel. With her were Blödhgarm and his spellcasters, bruised and scraped, but alive. In her arms, Arya carried a wooden chest <span>fitted</span> with gold hasps. A long line of metal boxes—each the size of the back of a wagon—floated along behind the elves, a few inches above the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elated, Eragon sprang up and ran over to meet them. “You’re alive!” He surprised Blödhgarm by grabbing the fur-covered elf and embracing him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Blödhgarm regarded him for a moment with his yellow eyes, and then he smiled, showing his fangs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We are alive, Shadeslayer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Are those the … Eldunarí?” Eragon asked, speaking the word softly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya nodded. “They were in Galbatorix’s treasure room. We will have to go back at some point; there are many wonders hidden therein.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How are they? The Eldunarí, I mean.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Confused. It will take them years to recover, if ever they do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And is that …?” Eragon motioned toward the chest she carried.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya glanced around to make sure no one was close enough to see; then she lifted the lid the width of a finger. Inside, nestled in velvet, Eragon saw a beautiful green dragon egg, webbed with veins of white.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The joy in Arya’s face lifted Eragon’s heart. He grinned and beckoned to the other elves. When they had gathered close to him, he whispered in the ancient language and told them of the eggs on Vroengard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They did not shout or laugh, but their eyes gleamed, and as a group, they seemed to vibrate with excitement. Still grinning, Eragon bounced on his heels, delighted by their reaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Saphira said, <span class="italic">Eragon!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the same time, Arya frowned and said, “Where are Thorn and Murtagh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shifted his gaze and saw Nasuada standing alone in the courtyard. Next to her was a pair of saddlebags that Eragon did not <span>remember</span> seeing on Thorn. Wind swept over the courtyard and he heard the sound of wings flapping, but of Murtagh and Thorn, nothing was visible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon cast his thoughts out toward where he thought they were. He felt them at once, for their minds were not hidden, but they refused to speak or listen to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Blast it,” muttered Eragon as he ran over to Nasuada. There were tears on her cheeks, and she seemed on the verge of losing her composure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Where are they going?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Away.” Her chin trembled. Then she took a breath, released it, and stood taller than before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Cursing again, Eragon bent and pulled open the saddlebags. Within, he found a number of smallish Eldunarí enclosed in padded cases. “Arya! Blödhgarm!” he shouted, pointing at the saddlebags. The two elves nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon ran over to Saphira. He did not have to explain himself; she understood. She spread her wings as he climbed onto her back, and the moment he was settled in the saddle, she took flight from the courtyard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Cheers rose from the city as the Varden caught sight of her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira flapped quickly, following Thorn’s musky scent trail through the air. It led her south, out from under the shadow of the overhang, and then it turned and curved up and around the great stone outcrop, heading north, toward the Ramr River.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For several miles, the trail ran straight and level. When the broad, tree-lined river was almost underneath them, the scent began to angle downward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon studied the ground ahead and saw a flash of red by the foot of a small hill on the other side of the river. <span class="italic">Over there</span>, he said to Saphira, but she had already spotted Thorn.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She spiraled down and landed softly atop the hill, where she had the advantage of height. The air off the water was cool and moist, <span>carrying</span> with it the scent of moss, mud, and sap. Between the hill and the river lay a sea of nettles. The plants grew in such thick profusion, the only way to pass through them would have been to cut a path. Their dark, sawtooth leaves rubbed against each other with a gentle susurration that blended with the sound of the rushing river.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">By the edge of the nettles sat Thorn. Murtagh stood next to him, adjusting the girth on his saddle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon loosened Brisingr in its sheath, then cautiously approached.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without turning around, Murtagh said, “Have you come to stop us?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That depends. Where are you going?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t know. North, maybe … somewhere away from other people.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You could stay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh uttered a bark of mirthless laughter. “You know better than that. It would only cause Nasuada problems. Besides, the dwarves would never stand for it. Not after I killed Hrothgar.” He glanced over his shoulder at Eragon. “Galbatorix used to call me Kingkiller. You’re Kingkiller as well now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It seems to run in the family.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’d better keep an eye on Roran, then. … And Arya is a dragonkiller. That can’t be easy for her—an elf killing a dragon. You should talk to her and make sure she’s all right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh’s insight surprised Eragon. “I will.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There,” said Murtagh, giving the strap a final tug. Then he turned to face Eragon, and Eragon saw that he had been holding Zar’roc close against his body, drawn and ready to use. “So, again: have you come to stop us?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh gave a thin smile and sheathed Zar’roc. “Good. I would hate to have to fight you again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How were you able to break free of Galbatorix? It was your true name, wasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh nodded. “As I said, I’m not … <span class="italic">we’re</span> not”—he touched Thorn’s side—“what we once were. It just took a while to realize it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And Nasuada.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh frowned. Then he turned away and stared out over the sea of nettles. As Eragon joined him, Murtagh said in a low voice, “Do you remember the last time we were at this river?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It would be hard to forget. I can still hear the screams of the horses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You, Saphira, Arya, and me, all together and sure that nothing could stop us. …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the back of his mind, Eragon could feel Saphira and Thorn talking to each other. Saphira, he knew, would tell him later what had passed between them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What will you do?” he asked Murtagh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sit and think. Maybe I’ll build a castle. I have the time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You don’t have to leave. I know it would be … difficult, but you have family here: me and also Roran. He’s your cousin as well as mine, and you’ve never even met him. … You belong as much to Carvahall and Palancar Valley as you do to Urû’baen, maybe more.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh shook his head and continued to stare over the nettles. “It wouldn’t work. Thorn and I need time alone; we need time to heal. If we stay, we’d be too busy to figure things out for ourselves.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Good company and staying busy are often the best cure for a sickness of the soul.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not for what Galbatorix did to us. … Besides, it would be painful to be around Nasuada right now, for both her and me. No, we have to leave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How long do you think you’ll be gone?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Until the world no longer seems quite so hateful and we no longer feel like tearing down mountains and filling the sea with blood.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To that, Eragon had no response. They stood looking at the river, where it lay behind a line of low willow trees. The rustling of the nettles grew louder, stirred by the westward wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon said, “When you no longer wish to be alone, come <span>find</span> us. You’ll always be welcome at our hearth, wherever that may be.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We will. I promise.” To Eragon’s surprise, he saw a gleam appear in Murtagh’s eyes. It vanished a second later. “You know,” Murtagh said, “I never thought you could do it … but I’m glad you did.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I was lucky. And it wouldn’t have been possible without your help.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Even so. … You found the Eldunarí in the saddlebags?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Good.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Should we tell them</span>? Eragon asked Saphira, hoping that she would agree.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She thought for a moment. <span class="italic">Yes, but do not say where. You tell him, and I will tell Thorn</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">As you wish</span>. To Murtagh, Eragon said, “There’s something you should know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh gave him a sideways glance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The egg that Galbatorix had—it isn’t the only one in Alagaësia. There are more, hidden in the same place where we found the Eldunarí we brought with us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh turned toward him, disbelief evident on his face. At the same time, Thorn arched his neck and uttered a joyful trumpet that scared a flight of swallows from the branches of a nearby tree.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How many more?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Hundreds.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a moment, Murtagh seemed unable to speak. Then: “What will you do with them?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Me? I think Saphira and the Eldunarí will have some say in the matter, but probably find somewhere safe for the eggs to hatch, and start to rebuild the Riders.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Will you and Saphira train them?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shrugged. “I’m sure the elves will help. You could as well, if you join us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh tilted his head back and released a long breath. “The <span>dragons</span> are going to return, and the Riders as well.” He laughed softly. “The world is about to change.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It has already changed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye. So you and Saphira will become the new leaders of the Riders, while Thorn and I will live in the wilderness.” Eragon tried to say something, to comfort him, but Murtagh stopped him with a look. “No, it is as it should be. You and Saphira will make better teachers than we would.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m not so sure of that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mmh … Promise me one thing, though.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“When you teach them—teach them not to fear. Fear is good in small amounts, but when it is a constant, pounding companion, it cuts away at who you are and makes it hard to do what you know is right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’ll try.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon noticed that Saphira and Thorn were no longer speaking. The red dragon shifted and moved around her until he was able to peer down at Eragon. With a mental voice that was surprisingly musical, Thorn said, <span class="italic">Thank you for not killing my Rider, Eragon-Murtagh’s-brother</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes, thank you,” Murtagh said dryly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m glad I didn’t have to,” Eragon said, looking Thorn in one glittering, blood-red eye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The dragon snorted, then bent and touched Eragon on the top of his head, tapping his scales against Eragon’s helm. <span class="italic">May the wind and the sun always be at your back</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And at yours.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A sense of great anger, grief, and ambivalence pressed heavily against Eragon as Glaedr’s consciousness enveloped his mind and, it seemed, those of Murtagh and Thorn, for they tensed, as if in anticipation of battle. Eragon had forgotten that Glaedr, along with the other Eldunarí—hidden within their invisible pocket of space—were present and listening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Would that I could thank you for the same</span>, said Glaedr, his words as bitter as an oak gall. <span class="italic">You killed my body and you killed my Rider</span>. The statement was flat and simple and all the more terrible because of it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh said something with his thoughts, but Eragon did not know what it was, for it was directed to Glaedr alone, and Eragon was privy only to Glaedr’s reaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No, I cannot</span>, said the gold dragon. <span class="italic">However, I understand that it was Galbatorix who drove you to it and that it was he who swung your arm, Murtagh. … I cannot forgive, but Galbatorix is dead and with him my desire for vengeance. Yours has always been a hard path, since each of you hatched. But today you showed that your misfortunes have not broken you. You turned against Galbatorix when it might have gained you only pain, and by it you allowed Eragon to kill him. Today you and Thorn proved yourselves worthy of being considered Shur’tugal in full, though you never had the proper instruction or guidance. That is … admirable</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh bowed his head slightly, and Thorn said, <span class="italic">Thank you, Ebrithil</span>, which Eragon heard. Thorn’s use of the honorific <span class="italic">ebrithil</span> seemed to startle Murtagh, for Murtagh looked back at the dragon and opened his mouth as if he was going to say something.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Umaroth spoke. <span class="italic">We know much of the difficulties you have faced, Thorn and Murtagh, for we have watched you from afar, even as we have watched Eragon and Saphira. There are many things we would teach you once you are ready, but until then, we will tell you this: in your wanderings, avoid the barrows of Anghelm, where the one and only Urgal king, Kulkarvek, lies in state. Avoid too the ruins of Vroengard and of El-harím. Beware the deeps, and tread not where the ground grows black and brittle and the air smells of brimstone, for in those places evil lurks. Do this and, unless you are greatly unfortunate, you shall not encounter danger beyond your ability to master</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh and Thorn thanked Umaroth, and then Murtagh cast a glance in the direction of Urû’baen and said, “We should be off.” He looked at Eragon again. “Can you remember the name of the ancient language now, or is Galbatorix’s magic still clouding your mind?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I can <span class="italic">almost</span> remember it, but …” Eragon shook his head with frustration.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Murtagh spoke the name of names twice: first to remove the spell of forgetfulness Galbatorix had placed on Eragon, and then again so that Eragon and Saphira might learn the name for themselves. “I wouldn’t share it with anyone else,” he said. “If every magician knew the name of the ancient language, the language would be worse than useless.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded, agreeing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Murtagh held out his hand and Eragon grasped him by the forearm. They stood like that for a moment, gazing at each other.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Be careful,” Eragon said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You too … Brother.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hesitated, then nodded again. “Brother.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh checked the straps on Thorn’s harness once more before he climbed up into the saddle. As Thorn spread his wings and started to move away, Murtagh called out, “See to it that Nasuada is well protected. Galbatorix had many servants, more than he ever told me about, and not all of them were bound to him by magic alone. They will seek revenge for the death of their master. Be on your guard at all times. There are those among them who are even more dangerous than the Ra’zac!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Murtagh raised a hand in farewell. Eragon did likewise, and Thorn took three loping steps away from the sea of nettles and leaped into the sky, leaving tracklike gouges in the soft earth below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sparkling red dragon circled over them once, twice, three times and then he turned and set off to the north, flapping with a slow, steady beat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon joined Saphira on the crest of the low hill, and together they watched as Thorn and Murtagh dwindled to a single starlike speck close to the horizon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a sense of sadness upon them both, Eragon took his place on Saphira’s back, and they departed from the knoll and returned thence to Urû’baen.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_154"></div></body>
