<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">“<span><span class="calibre27">HOW DO YOU</span></span> like having a sister?” Roran asked Baldor as they rode side by side toward the nearest set of mills in the gray half-light that precedes dawn.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There’s not much to like, is there? I mean, there’s not much <span class="italic">of</span> her yet, if you take my meaning. She’s as small as a kitten.” Baldor tugged on his reins as his horse tried to veer toward a patch of particularly lush grass next to the trail. “It’s strange to have another sibling—brother <span class="italic">or</span> sister—after so long.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran nodded. Twisting in the saddle, he glanced back over his shoulder, checking to make sure that the column of six hundred and fifty men who were following them on foot were keeping pace. At the mills, Roran dismounted and tethered his horse to a hitching post before the lowest of the three buildings. One warrior stayed behind to escort the animals back to camp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran walked over to the canal and descended the wooden steps set within the muddy bank, which brought him to the edge of the water. Then he stepped out onto the rearmost of the four barges that were floating together in a line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The barges were more like crude rafts than the flat-bottomed boats the villagers had ridden down the coast from Narda to Teirm, for which Roran was grateful, because it meant that they did not have pointed prows. This had made it relatively easy to fasten the four barges end to end with boards, nails, and ropes, thus creating a single rigid structure almost five hundred feet long.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The slabs of cut slate that the men had, at Roran’s direction, hauled in wagons from the mine lay piled at the front of the lead barge, as well as along the sides of both the first and second barges. <span>On</span> top of the slate, they had heaped sacks of flour—which they had found stored within the mills—until they had built a wall level with their waists. Where the slate ended on the second barge, the wall continued on, composed entirely of the sacks: two deep and five high.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The immense weight of the slate and the densely packed flour, combined with that of the barges themselves, served to transform the entire floating structure into a massive, waterborne battering ram, which Roran hoped would be capable of plowing through the gate at the far end of the canal as if it were made of so many rotted sticks. Even if the gate was enchanted—though Carn did not believe it was—Roran didn’t think any one magician, save Galbatorix, would be strong enough to negate the forward momentum of the barges once they began to move downstream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Also, the mounds of stone and flour would provide a measure of protection from spears, arrows, and other projectiles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran carefully made his way across the shifting decks to the head of the barges. He wedged his spear and his shield against a pile of slate, then turned to watch as the warriors filed into the corridor between the walls.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Every man who boarded pushed the heavily laden barges deeper and deeper into the water, until they rode only a few inches above the surface.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Carn, Baldor, Hamund, Delwin, and Mandel joined Roran where he stood. They had all, by unspoken consent, elected to take for themselves the most dangerous position on the floating ram. If the Varden were to force their way into Aroughs, it would require a high degree of luck and skill, and none of them were willing to trust the attempt to anyone else.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Toward the rear of the barges, Roran glimpsed Brigman standing among the men he had once commanded. After Brigman’s near insubordination the previous day, Roran had stripped him of all remaining authority and confined him to his tent. However, Brigman had begged to be allowed to join the final attack on Aroughs, and <span>Roran</span> had reluctantly agreed; Brigman was handy with a blade, and every sword would make a difference in the upcoming fight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran still wondered if he had made the right decision. He was fairly confident that the men were now loyal to him, not to Brigman, but Brigman had been their captain for many months, and such bonds were not easily forgotten. Even if Brigman did not try to cause trouble in the ranks, he had proved willing and able to ignore orders, at least when they came from Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If he gives me any reason to distrust him, I’ll strike him down on the spot</span>, Roran thought. But the resolution was a futile one. If Brigman did turn on him, it would most likely be in the midst of such confusion that Roran would not even notice until it was too late.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When all but six of the men were packed onto the barges, Roran cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted, “Pry them loose!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Two men stood upon the berm at the very top of the hill—the berm that slowed and held back the flow of water down the canal from the marshes to the north. Twenty feet below them lay the first waterwheel and the pool beneath it. At the front of that pool was the second berm, whereon stood two more men. Another twenty feet below them was the second waterwheel and the second deep, still pool. At the far end of the pool was the final berm and the final pair of men. And at the base of the final berm was the third and last waterwheel. From it, the current then flowed smoothly over the land until it arrived at Aroughs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Built into the berms were the three sluice gates Roran had insisted upon closing, with Baldor’s help, during his first visit to the mills. Over the course of the past two days, teams of men wielding shovels and pickaxes had dived under the rising water and cut away at the berms from the backsides until the layers of packed earth were nearly ready to give way. Then they had driven long, stout beams into the dirt on either side of the sluice gates.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The men on the middle and topmost berms now grasped those beams—which protruded several feet from the embankments—and began to work them back and forth with a steady rhythm. In <span>accordance</span> with their plan, the duo stationed on the lowest berm waited several moments before they, too, joined in the effort.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran gripped a flour sack as he watched. If their timing was off by even a few seconds, disaster would ensue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For almost a minute, nothing happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then, with an ominous rumble, the topmost sluice gate was pried free. The berm bulged outward, the earth cracking and crumbling, and a huge tongue of muddy water poured over the waterwheel below, spinning it faster than it was ever intended to turn.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the berm collapsed, the men standing on top of it jumped to shore, landing with only inches to spare.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Spray shot up thirty feet or more as the tongue of water plunged into the smooth black pool underneath the waterwheel. The impact sent a frothing wave several feet high rushing toward the next berm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Seeing it coming, the middlemost pair of warriors abandoned their posts, also leaping for the safety of solid ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was well they did. When the wave struck, needle-thin jets erupted around the frame of the next sluice gate, which then flew out of its setting as if a dragon had kicked it, and the churning contents of the pool swept away what remained of the berm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The raging torrent crashed against the second waterwheel with even more force than it had the previous one. The timbers groaned and creaked under the onslaught, and for the first time, it occurred to Roran that one or more of the wheels might break loose. If that happened, it would pose a serious danger to his men, as well as to the barges, and could very well end the attack on Aroughs before it had even begun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Cut us loose!” he shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">One of the men chopped through the rope that tethered them to the bank, while others bent to pick up ten-foot-long poles, which they stuck into the canal and pushed on with all their might.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The heavily laden barges inched forward, gaining speed far slower than Roran would have liked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even as the avalanche of water bore down upon them, the two <span>men</span> standing on the lowest berm continued to pull on the beams embedded within the weakened rampart. Less than a second before the avalanche washed over them, the berm shuddered and sagged, and the men threw themselves off of it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The water punched a hole in the earthen dam as easily as if it were made of sodden bread and slammed into the final waterwheel. Wood shattered—the sound as loud and sharp as breaking ice—and the wheel canted outward several degrees, but to Roran’s relief, it held. Then, with a thunderous roar, the pillar of water dashed itself against the base of the terraced hill with an explosion of mist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A gust of cold wind slapped Roran in the face, more than two hundred yards downstream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Faster!” he shouted to the men poling the barge, as a turbulent mass of water emerged from within the folds of mist and hurtled down the canal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The flood overtook them with incredible speed. When it collided with the back of the four conjoined barges, the entire craft jolted forward, throwing Roran and the warriors toward the stern and knocking a number of them off their feet. Some sacks of flour dropped into the canal or rolled inward, against the men.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the surging water lifted the rearmost barge several feet above the rest, the nearly five-hundred-foot-long vessel began to slue sideways. If the trend continued, Roran knew they would soon become wedged between the banks of the canal, and that, moments later, the force of the current would tear the barges apart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Keep us straight!” he bellowed, pushing himself off the sacks of flour he had fallen on. “Don’t let us turn!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the sound of his voice, the warriors scrambled to push the lumbering vessel away from the sloping banks and toward the center of the canal. Springing atop the piles of slate at the prow, Roran shouted directions, and together they successfully steered the barges down the curving channel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We did it!” Baldor exclaimed, a stupid grin on his face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Don’t crow yet,” Roran warned. “We still have a ways to go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The eastern sky had turned straw yellow by the time they were level with their camp, a mile from Aroughs. At the speed they were moving, they would reach the city before the sun peeked over the horizon, and the gray shadows that covered the land would help shroud them from the lookouts stationed on the walls and towers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Although the leading edge of the water had already outstripped them, the barges were still gathering speed, as the city lay below the mills and there was not a single hill or hummock between to slow their progress.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Listen,” said Roran, cupping his hands around his mouth and raising his voice so that all the men could hear. “We may fall into the water when we hit the outer gate, so be prepared to swim. Until we can get onto dry land, we’ll make easy targets. Once we’re ashore, we have but one goal: to make our way up to the inner wall before they think to close the gates there, because if they do, we’ll never capture Aroughs. If we can get past that second wall, it should be a simple matter to find Lord Halstead and force his surrender. Failing that, we’ll secure the fortifications at the center of the city, then move outward, street by street, until all of Aroughs is under our control.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Remember, we’ll be outnumbered by more than two to one, so stay close to your shield mate and be on your guard at all times. Don’t wander off by yourself, and don’t let yourself be separated from the rest of the group. The soldiers know the streets better than we do, and they’ll ambush you when you least expect it. If you do end up alone, head for the center, because that’s where we’ll be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Today we strike a mighty blow for the Varden. Today we win honor and glory such as most men dream about. Today … today we grave our mark onto the face of history. What we accomplish in the next few hours, the bards will sing about for a hundred years to come. Think of your friends. Think of your families, of your parents, your wives, your children. Fight well, for we fight for them. We fight for freedom!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The men roared in response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran let them work themselves into a frenzy; then he lifted a hand and said, “Shields!” And, as one, the men crouched and lifted their shields, covering themselves and their companions so that it looked as if the middle of the makeshift battering ram were clad in scale armor made to fit the limb of a giant.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Satisfied, Roran hopped down from the pile of slate and looked at Carn, Baldor, and the four other men who had traveled with him from Belatona. The youngest, Mandel, appeared apprehensive, but Roran knew his nerves would hold.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ready?” he asked, and they each answered in the affirmative.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Roran laughed, and when Baldor pressed him for an explanation, he said, “If only my father could see me now!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And Baldor laughed as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran kept a keen eye on the main swell of the water. Once it entered the city, the soldiers might notice that something was amiss and raise the alarm. He wanted them to raise the alarm, but not for that reason, and so, when it appeared the swell was about five minutes away from Aroughs, he motioned to Carn and said, “Send the signal.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The magician nodded and hunched over, his lips moving as they formed the strange shapes of the ancient language. After a few moments, he straightened and said, “It is done.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran looked off to the west. There, on the field before Aroughs, stood the Varden’s catapults, ballistae, and siege towers. The siege towers remained motionless, but the other engines of war stirred into action, casting their darts and stones in high, arcing paths toward the pristine white walls of the city. And he knew that fifty of his men on the far side of the city were even then blowing trumpets, yelling war cries, firing flaming arrows, and doing everything they could to draw the attention of the defending soldiers and make it appear as if a far larger force were attempting to storm the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A deep calm settled over Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Battle was about to be joined.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Men were about to die.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He might be one of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Knowing this gave him a clarity of thought, and every trace of exhaustion vanished, along with the faint tremor that had plagued him since the attempt on his life just hours before. Nothing was so invigorating as fighting—not food, not laughter, not working with his hands, not even love—and though he hated it, he could not deny the power of its attraction. He had never wanted to be a warrior, but a warrior he had become, and he was determined to best all who came before him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Squatting, Roran peered between two sharp-edged slabs of slate at the rapidly approaching gate that barred their path. To the surface of the water and somewhat below, for the water had risen, the gate was made of solid oak planks, stained dark with age and moisture. Beneath the surface, he knew there was a grid of iron and wood, much like a portcullis, through which the water was free to pass. The upper part would be the most difficult to breach, but he guessed that long periods of immersion had weakened the grid below, and if part of it could be torn away, breaking through the oak boards above would be far easier. Thus, he had ordered two stout logs attached to the underside of the lead barge. Since these were submerged, they would strike the lower half of the gate even as the prow rammed into the upper.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was a clever plan, but he had no idea if it would really work.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Steady,” he whispered more to himself than anyone else as the gate drew near.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A few of the warriors near the rear of the craft continued to steer the barges with their poles, but the rest remained hidden beneath the lapped carapace of shields.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The mouth of the archway that led to the gate loomed large before them, like the entrance to a cave. As the tip of the vessel slid underneath the shadowed archway, Roran saw the face of a soldier, as round and white as a full moon, appear over the edge of the wall, <span>more</span> than thirty feet above, and peer down at the barges with an expression of horrified astonishment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The barges were moving so fast by then, Roran only had time to utter a single pungent curse before the current swept them into the cool darkness of the passageway, and the vaulted ceiling cut off his view of the soldier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The barges struck the gate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The force of the impact threw Roran forward against the wall of slate he squatted behind. His head bounced off the stone, and though he wore a helm and arming cap, his ears rang. The deck shuddered and reared, and even through the noise in his ears, he heard wood cracking and breaking, and the shriek of twisting metal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">One of the slate slabs slipped backward and fell onto him, bruising his arms and shoulders. He grabbed the slab by the edges and, with a burst of furious strength, threw it overboard, where it shattered against the side of the passageway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the gloom that surrounded them, it was difficult to see what was happening; all was shifting confusion and echoing clamor. Water poured over his feet, and he realized that the barge was awash, though whether it would sink, he could not tell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Give me an ax!” he shouted, holding a hand out behind him. “An ax, give me an ax!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He staggered as the barge lurched forward half a foot, nearly knocking him over. The gate had caved inward somewhat, but it was still holding firm. In time, the continued pressure of the water might push the barge through the gate, but he could not wait for nature to take its course.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As someone pressed the smooth haft of an ax into his outstretched hand, six glowing rectangles appeared in the ceiling as covers were drawn back from murder holes. The rectangles flickered, and crossbow bolts hissed down upon the barges, adding loud <span class="italic">thumps</span> to the tumult wherever they struck wood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Somewhere a man screamed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Carn!” shouted Roran. “Do something!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Leaving the magician to his devices, Roran started to crawl up the heaving deck and over the piles of slate toward the prow of the barge. And the barge lurched forward several more inches. Another deafening groan emanated from the center of the gate, and light shone through cracks in the oaken planks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A quarrel skipped off the slate next to Roran’s right hand, leaving a smear of iron on the stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He redoubled his speed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Just as he reached the very front of the barge, a piercing, grating, tearing sound forced him to clap his hands over his ears and pull back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A heavy wave washed over him, blinding him for a moment. Blinking to clear his vision, he saw that part of the gate had collapsed into the canal; there was now enough space for the barge to gain access to the city. Above the prow of the vessel, however, jagged spars of wood stuck out from the remnants of the gate at the same height as a man’s chest, neck, or head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without hesitation, Roran rolled backward and dropped behind the breastwork of slate. “Heads down!” he roared, covering himself with his shield.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The barges glided forward, out of the hail of deadly crossbow bolts and into an enormous stone room lit by torches mounted on the walls.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the far end of the room, the water in the canal flowed through another lowered gate, this one a portcullis from top to bottom. Through the latticework of wood and metal, Roran could see buildings within the city proper.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Extending from both sides of the room were stone quays for loading and unloading cargo. Pulleys, ropes, and empty nets hung from the ceiling, and a crane was mounted upon a high stone platform in the middle of each artificial shore. At the front of the room and at the back, stairs and walkways protruding from the mold-covered walls would allow a person to cross over the water without getting <span>wet</span>. The rear walkway also granted access to the guardrooms above the tunnel the barges had entered through, as well as, Roran assumed, to the upper part of the city’s defenses, such as the parapet where he had seen the soldier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Frustration welled up inside of Roran as he beheld the lowered gate. He had hoped to be able to sail straight into the main body of the city and avoid getting trapped on the water by the guards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Well, it can’t be helped now</span>, he thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind them, crimson-clad soldiers poured out of the guardrooms onto the walkway, where they knelt and began to crank on their crossbows, readying them for another volley.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Over!” Roran shouted, waving his arm toward the docks on the left. The warriors grabbed their poles once more and pushed the interlocked barges toward the edge of the canal. The dozens and dozens of bolts that protruded from their shields gave the company the appearance of a hedgehog.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the barge neared the docks, twenty of the defending soldiers drew their swords and ran down the stairs off the walkway to intercept the Varden before they could land.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Hurry!” he shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A bolt buried itself in his shield, the diamond-shaped tip boring through the inch-and-a-half-thick wood to protrude over his forearm. He stumbled and caught himself, knowing that he had only moments before more archers fired on him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Roran jumped for the dock, arms spread wide for balance. He landed heavily, one knee striking the floor, and only just had time to pull his hammer from his belt before the soldiers were upon him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was with a sense of relief and savage joy that Roran met them. He was sick of plotting and planning and worrying about what might be. Here at last were honest foes—not creeping assassins—that he could fight and kill.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The encounter was short, fierce, and bloody. Roran slew or <span>incapacitated</span> three of the soldiers within the first few seconds. Then Baldor, Delwin, Hamund, Mandel, and others joined him to force the soldiers away from the water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran was no swordsman, so he made no attempt to fence with his opponents. Instead, he let them hit his shield all they wanted, while he used his hammer to break their bones in return. Occasionally, he had to parry a cut or a stab, but he tried to avoid exchanging more than a few blows with any one person, because he knew his lack of experience would soon prove fatal. The most useful trick of fighting, he had discovered, was not some fancy twirl of the sword or some complicated feint that took years to master, but rather seizing the initiative and doing whatever his enemy least expected.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Breaking free of the brawl, Roran sprinted toward the stairs that led to the walkway where the archers knelt, firing at the men scrambling off the barges.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran bounded up the stairs three at a time and, swinging his hammer, caught the first archer full in the face. The next soldier in line had already fired his crossbow, so he dropped it and reached for the hilt of his short sword, retreating backward as he did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The soldier only managed to pull his blade partway out of its sheath before Roran struck him in the chest, breaking his ribs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">One of the things Roran liked about fighting with a hammer was that he did not have to pay much attention to what kind of armor his opponents were wearing. A hammer, like any blunt weapon, inflicted injuries by the strength of its impact, not by the cutting or piercing of flesh. The simplicity of the approach appealed to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The third soldier on the walkway managed to shoot a bolt at him before he took another step. This time the shaft of the quarrel made it halfway through his shield and almost poked him in the chest. Keeping the deadly point well away from his body, Roran charged the man and swung at his shoulder. The soldier used his crossbow to block the attack, so Roran immediately followed with a backhand <span>blow</span> of his shield, which knocked the soldier screaming and flailing over the railing of the walkway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The maneuver left Roran wholly exposed, however, and as he returned his attention to the five soldiers who remained on the walkway, he saw three of them aiming straight at his heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The soldiers fired.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Just before the bolts tore through him, they veered to the right and skittered across the blackened walls, like giant angry wasps.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran knew it was Carn who had saved him, and he resolved to find some way to thank the magician once they were no longer in mortal danger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He charged the remaining soldiers and dispatched them with a furious volley of strikes, as if they were so many bent nails he was hammering down. Then he broke off the crossbow bolt that was sticking through his shield and turned to see how the battle below was progressing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The last soldier on the docks crumpled to the blood-streaked floor at that very moment, and his head rolled away from his body and dropped into the canal, where it sank beneath a plume of bubbles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roughly two-thirds of the Varden had disembarked and were gathering in orderly ranks along the edge of the water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran opened his mouth, intending to order them to move back from the canal—so that the men still on the barges had more room to get off—when the doors set into the left wall burst open and a horde of soldiers poured into the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Blast it! Where are they coming from? And how many are there</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Just as Roran started toward the stairs to help his men fend off the newcomers, Carn—who still stood at the head of the listing barges—raised his arms, pointed at the onrushing soldiers, and shouted a series of harsh, twisted words in the ancient language.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At his eldritch command, two sacks of flour and a single slab of slate flew off the barges and into the ranks of closely packed soldiers, cutting down over a dozen. The sacks burst open after the third or <span>fourth</span> impact, and clouds of ivory flour billowed out over the soldiers, blinding and choking them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A second later, there was a flare of light next to the wall behind the soldiers, and a huge roiling fireball, orange and sooty, raced through the clouds of flour, devouring the fine powder with rapacious greed and producing a sound like a hundred flags flapping in a high wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran ducked behind his shield and felt searing heat against his legs and the bare skin of his cheeks as the fireball burned itself out only yards away from the walkway, glowing motes becoming ash that drifted downward: a black, charnel rain fitting only for a funeral.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once the sullen glare had faded, he cautiously raised his head. A tendril of hot, foul-smelling smoke tickled his nostrils and stung his eyes, and with a start, he realized that his beard was on fire. He cursed and dropped his hammer and batted at the tiny grasping flames until he had extinguished them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oi!” he shouted down at Carn. “You singed my beard! Be more careful, or I’ll have your head on a pike!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Most of the soldiers lay curled on the ground, cupping their burned faces. Others were thrashing about with their clothes on fire or were flailing blindly in circles with their weapons, in an attempt to fend off any attacks by the Varden. Roran’s own men appeared to have escaped with only minor burns—most had been standing outside the radius of the fireball—although the unexpected conflagration had left them disoriented and unsteady.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Stop gaping like fools and get after those groping rascals before they regain their senses!” he ordered, banging his hammer against the railing to ensure that he had their attention.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The Varden heavily outnumbered the soldiers, and by the time Roran reached the bottom of the stairs, they had already put to death fully three-quarters of the defending force.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Leaving the disposal of the few remaining soldiers to his more-than-able warriors, Roran made his way toward the large double <span>doors</span> to the left of the canal—doors wide enough for two wagons to drive through abreast. As he did, he came upon Carn, who was sitting at the base of the crane’s platform, eating out of a leather pouch he always carried. The pouch, Roran knew, contained a mixture of lard, honey, powdered beef liver, lamb’s heart, and berries. The one time Carn had given him a piece, he had gagged—but even a few bites could keep a man on his feet for a whole day’s worth of hard work.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To Roran’s concern, the magician looked utterly exhausted. “Can you continue?” Roran asked, pausing by him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Carn nodded. “I just need a moment. … The bolts in the tunnel, and then the sacks of flour and the piece of slate …” He pushed another morsel of food in his mouth. “It was a bit much all at once.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Reassured, Roran started to move away, but Carn caught him by the arm. “I didn’t do it,” he said, and his eyes crinkled with amusement. “Singe your beard, that is. The torches must have started the fire.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran grunted, and continued on to the doors. “Form up!” he shouted, and slapped his shield with the flat of his hammer. “Baldor, Delwin, you take the lead with me. The rest of you, line up behind us. Shields out, swords drawn, arrows nocked. Halstead probably doesn’t know yet that we’re in the city, so don’t let anyone escape who could warn him. … Ready, then? Right, with me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Together he and Baldor—whose cheeks and nose were red from the explosion—unbarred the doors and threw them open, revealing the interior of Aroughs.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_51"></div></body>
