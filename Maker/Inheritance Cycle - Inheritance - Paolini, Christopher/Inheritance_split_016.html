<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">FAINT LIGHT FROM</span></span> the dying sun seeped into Eragon’s tent. Everything within was gray, as if it were carved from granite. With his elf vision, Eragon could see the shape of objects easily enough, but he knew that Gertrude would have trouble, so for her sake he said, “Naina hvitr un böllr,” and set a small, glowing werelight floating in the air by the peak of the tent. The soft white orb produced no discernible heat but as much illumination as a bright lantern. He refrained from using the word <span class="italic">brisingr</span> in the spell, so as to avoid setting the blade of his sword on fire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He heard Gertrude pause behind him, and he turned to see her staring at the werelight and clutching at the bag she had brought with her. Her familiar face reminded him of home and Carvahall, and he felt an unexpected lurch of homesickness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She slowly lowered her gaze to his. “How you have changed,” she said. “The boy I once sat watch over as he fought off a fever is long gone, I think.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You know me still,” he replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, I don’t believe I do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her statement troubled him, but he could not afford to dwell on it, so he pushed it out of his mind and went to his cot. Gently, ever so gently, he transferred the newborn from his arms onto the blankets, as carefully as if she were made of glass. The girl waved a clenched fist at him. He smiled and touched it with the tip of his right forefinger, and she burbled softly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What do you intend to do?” asked Gertrude as she sat on the lone stool near the tent wall. “How will you heal her?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m not sure.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Just then, Eragon noticed that Arya had not accompanied them into the tent. He called her name, and a moment later, she answered from outside, her voice muffled by the thick fabric that separated them. “I am here,” she said. “And here I shall wait. If you have need of me, you have but to cast your thoughts in my direction and I shall come.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon frowned slightly. He had counted on having her close at hand during the procedure, to help him where he was ignorant and to correct him if he made any mistake. <span class="italic">Well, no matter. I can still ask her questions if I want to. Only this way, Gertrude will have no reason to suspect that Arya had anything to do with the girl</span>. He was struck by the precautions that Arya was taking in order to avoid arousing suspicion that the girl was a changeling, and he wondered if she had once been accused of stealing someone’s child.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The frame of the cot creaked as he slowly lowered himself onto it, facing the infant. His frown deepened. Through him, he felt Saphira watching the girl as she lay on the blankets, now dozing, seemingly oblivious to the world. Her tongue glistened within the cleft that split her upper lip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What do you think</span>? he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Go slowly, so that you do not bite your tail by accident</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He agreed with her, then, feeling impish, asked, <span class="italic">And have you ever done that? Bitten your tail, I mean</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She remained silently aloof, but he caught a brief flash of sensations: a medley of images—trees, grass, sunshine, the mountains of the Spine—as well as the cloying scent of red orchids and a sudden painful, pinching sensation, as if a door had slammed shut on her tail.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon chuckled quietly to himself, then concentrated on composing the spells he thought he would need to heal the girl. It took quite a while, almost a half hour. He and Saphira spent most of that time going over the arcane sentences again and again, examining and debating every word and phrase—and even his <span>pronunciation</span>—in an attempt to ensure that the spells would do what he intended and nothing more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the midst of their silent conversation, Gertrude shifted in her seat and said, “She looks the same as ever. The work goes badly, doesn’t it? There is no need to hide the truth from me, Eragon; I have dealt with far worse in my day.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon raised his eyebrows and, in a mild voice, said, “The work has not yet begun.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And Gertrude sank back, subdued. From within her bag, she removed a ball of yellow yarn, a half-finished sweater, and a pair of polished birch knitting needles. Her fingers moved with practiced speed, quick and deft, as she began to knit and purl. The steady clacking of her needles comforted Eragon; it was a sound he had heard often during his childhood, one that he associated with sitting around a kitchen fireplace on cool autumn evenings, listening to the adults tell stories while they smoked a pipe or savored a draught of dark brown ale after a large dinner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last, when he and Saphira were satisfied that the spells were safe, and Eragon was confident that his tongue would not trip over any of the strange sounds of the ancient language, Eragon drew upon the combined strength of both their bodies and prepared to cast the first of the enchantments.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he hesitated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When the elves used magic to coax a tree or a flower to grow in the shape they desired, or to alter their body or that of another creature, they always, so far as he knew, couched the spell in the form of a song. It seemed only fitting that he should do the same. But he was acquainted with only a few of the elves’ many songs and none of them well enough to accurately—or even adequately—reproduce such beautiful and complex melodies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So, instead, he chose a song from the deepest recesses of his memory, a song that his aunt Marian had sung to him when he was little, before the sickness had taken her, a song that the women <span>of</span> Carvahall had crooned to their children from time immemorial when they tucked them under the covers for a long night’s sleep: a lullaby—a cradle song. The notes were simple, easy to remember, and had a soothing quality that he hoped would help keep the infant calm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He began, soft and low, letting the words roll forth slowly, the sound of his voice spreading through the tent like warmth from a fire. Before he used magic, he told the girl in the ancient language that he was her friend, that he meant her well, and that she should trust him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She stirred in her sleep, as if in response, and her clenched expression softened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon intoned the first of the spells: a simple incantation that consisted of two short sentences, which he recited over and over again, like a prayer. And the small pink hollow where the two sides of the girl’s divided lip met shimmered and crawled, as if a dormant creature were stirring beneath the surface.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">What he was attempting was far from easy. The infant’s bones, like those of every newborn child, were soft and cartilaginous, different from those of an adult and thus different from all of the bones he had mended during his time with the Varden. He had to be careful not to fill the gap in her mouth with the bone, flesh, and skin of an adult, or those areas would not grow properly along with the rest of her body. Also, when he repaired the gap in her upper palate and gums, he would have to move, straighten, and make symmetrical the roots of what would become her two front teeth, something he had never done before. And further complicating the process was the fact that he had never seen the girl without her deformity, so he was uncertain how her lip and mouth ought to appear. She looked like every other baby he had seen: round, pudgy, and lacking definition. He worried, then, that he might give her a face that appeared pleasant enough at the moment, but that would become strange and unattractive as the years passed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So he proceeded cautiously, making only small changes at a time <span>and</span> pausing after each one to ponder the result. He started with the deepest layers of the girl’s face, with the bones and cartilage, and slowly worked his way outward, singing all the while.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At a certain point, Saphira began to hum along with him from where she lay outside, her deep voice making the air vibrate. The werelight brightened and dimmed in accordance with the volume of her humming, a phenomenon that Eragon found exceedingly curious. He resolved to ask Saphira about it later.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Word by word, spell by spell, hour by hour, the night wore on, though Eragon paid no attention to the time. When the girl cried from hunger, he fed her with a trickle of energy. He and Saphira tried to avoid touching her mind with theirs—not knowing how the contact might affect her immature consciousness—but they still brushed against it occasionally; her mind felt vague and indistinct to Eragon, a thrashing sea of unmoderated emotions that reduced everything else in the world to insignificance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Beside him, Gertrude’s needles continued to clack, the only interruption in the rhythm coming when the healer lost count of her stitches or had to tink back several knits or purls in order to correct a mistake.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Slowly, ever so slowly, the fissure in the girl’s gums and palate fused into a seamless whole, the two sides of her cat lip pulled together—her skin flowing like liquid—and her upper lip gradually formed a pink bow free of flaws.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon fiddled and tweaked and worried over the shape of her lip for the longest while, until at last Saphira said, <span class="italic">It is done. Leave it</span>, and he was forced to admit that he could not improve the girl’s appearance any more, only make it worse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he let the cradle song fade to silence. His tongue felt thick and dry, his throat raw. He pushed himself off the cot and stood half crouched over it, too stiff to straighten up entirely.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In addition to the illumination from the werelight, a pale glow pervaded the tent, the same as when he had started. At first he was confused—surely the sun had already set!—but then he realized <span>that</span> the glow was coming from the east, not the west, and he understood. <span class="italic">No wonder I’m so sore. I’ve been sitting here the whole night through!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And what about me</span>? said Saphira. <span class="italic">My bones ache as much as yours</span>. Her admission surprised him; she rarely acknowledged her own discomfort, no matter how extreme. The fighting must have taken a greater toll on her than had first been apparent. As he reached that conclusion, and Saphira became aware of it, she withdrew from him slightly and said, <span class="italic">Tired or not, I can still crush however many soldiers Galbatorix sends against us</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I know</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Returning the knitting to her bag, Gertrude stood and hobbled over to the cot. “Never did I think to see such a thing,” she said. “Least of all from you, Eragon Bromsson.” She peered at him inquiringly. “Brom <span class="italic">was</span> your father, wasn’t he?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded, then croaked, “That he was.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It seems fitting, somehow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was not inclined to discuss the topic further, so he merely grunted and extinguished the werelight with a glance and a thought. Instantly, all went dark, save for the predawn glow. His eyes adjusted to the change faster than Gertrude’s; she blinked and frowned and swung her head from side to side, as if unsure of where he stood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The girl was warm and heavy in Eragon’s arms as he picked her up. He was uncertain whether his weariness was due to the magic he had wrought or to the sheer length of time the task had taken him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He gazed down at the girl and, feeling suddenly protective, murmured, “Sé ono waíse ilia.” May you be happy. It was not a spell, not properly, but he hoped that maybe it could help her avoid some of the misery that afflicted so many people. Failing that, he hoped it would make her smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It did. A wide smile spread across her diminutive face, and with great enthusiasm, she said, “Gahh!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon smiled as well, then turned and strode outside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the entrance flaps fell away, he saw a small crowd gathered in <span>a</span> semicircle around the tent, some standing, some sitting, others squatting. Most he recognized from Carvahall, but Arya and the other elves were also there—somewhat apart from the rest—as well as several warriors of the Varden whose names he did not know. He spotted Elva lurking behind a nearby tent, her black lace veil lowered, hiding her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The group, Eragon realized, must have been waiting for hours, and he had not sensed anything of their presence. He had been safe enough with Saphira and the elves keeping watch, but that was no excuse for allowing himself to become so complacent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I have to do better</span>, he told himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the forefront of the crowd stood Horst and his sons, looking worried. Horst’s brow knotted as he gazed at the bundle in Eragon’s arms, and he opened his mouth as if to say something, but no sound came forth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without pomp or ceremony, Eragon walked over to the smith and turned the girl so that he could see her face. For a moment, Horst did not move; then his eyes began to glisten and his expression changed to one of joy and relief so profound, it could have been mistaken for grief.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he gave the girl to Horst, Eragon said, “My hands are too bloody for this kind of work, but I’m glad I was able to help.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Horst touched the girl’s upper lip with the tip of his middle finger, then shook his head. “I can’t believe it. … I can’t believe it.” He looked at Eragon. “Elain and I are forevermore in your debt. If—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There is no debt,” Eragon said gently. “I only did what anyone would if they had the ability.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But you were the one who healed her, and it’s to you I’m grateful.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hesitated, then bowed his head, accepting Horst’s gratitude. “What will you name her?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The smith beamed at his daughter. “If it’s agreeable to Elain, I thought we might call her Hope.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Hope … A good name, that.” <span class="italic">And don’t we need some hope in our lives</span>? “And how is Elain?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Tired, but well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Albriech and Baldor clustered around their father, peering at their new sister, as did Gertrude—who had emerged from the tent soon after Eragon—and once their shyness faded, the rest of the villagers joined them. Even the group of curious warriors pressed close to Horst, craning their necks in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the girl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a while, the elves unfolded their long limbs and approached as well. Seeing them, people quickly stepped out of the way, clearing a path to Horst. The smith stiffened and pushed his jaw out like a bulldog’s as, one by one, the elves bent and examined the girl, sometimes whispering a word or two in the ancient language to her. They did not seem to notice or mind the suspicious stares that the villagers cast at them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When only three elves were left in line, Elva darted out from behind the tent where she had been concealing herself and joined the end of the procession. She did not have to wait long before it was her turn to stand before Horst. Although he appeared reluctant, the smith lowered his arms and bent his knees, but he was so much taller than Elva, she had to rise up on the tips of her toes in order to see the infant. Eragon held his breath as she gazed at the formerly deformed child, unable to guess her reaction through her veil.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a few seconds, Elva dropped back onto her heels. With a deliberate pace, she started down the path that ran past Eragon’s tent. Twenty yards away, she stopped and turned toward him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He tilted his head and lifted an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded, a short, abrupt movement, then continued on her way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Eragon watched her go, Arya sidled up to him. “You should be proud of what you have accomplished,” she murmured. “The child is sound and well formed. Not even our most skilled enchanters could improve on your gramarye. It is a great thing, what you have given this girl—a face and a future—and she will not forget it, I am sure. … None of us will.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon saw that she and all the elves were regarding him with a look of newfound respect—but it was Arya’s admiration and approval that meant the most to him. “I had the best of teachers,” he replied in an equally low voice. Arya did not dispute his assertion. Together they watched the villagers mill around Horst and his daughter, talking excitedly. Without taking his eyes off them, Eragon leaned toward Arya and said, “Thank you for helping Elain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re welcome. I would have been remiss not to.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Horst turned then and carried the child into the tent so that Elain might see her newborn daughter, but the knot of people showed no signs of dispersing. When Eragon was fed up with shaking hands and answering questions, he said farewell to Arya, then slipped off to his tent and tied the flaps closed behind him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Unless we’re under attack, I don’t want to see anyone for the next ten hours, not even Nasuada</span>, he said to Saphira as he threw himself onto his cot. <span class="italic">Will you tell Blödhgarm, please</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Of course</span>, she said. <span class="italic">Rest, little one, as will I</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon sighed and draped an arm over his face to block the morning light. His breathing slowed, his mind began to wander, and soon the strange sights and sounds of his waking dreams enveloped him—real, yet imaginary; vivid, yet transparent, as if the visions were made of colored glass—and, for a time, he was able to forget his responsibilities and the harrowing events of the past day. And all through his dreams, there wound the cradle song, like a whisper of wind, half heard, half forgotten, and it lulled him, with memories of his home, into a childlike peace.</span></p>
