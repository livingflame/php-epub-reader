<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">IT WAS EARLY</span></span> in the afternoon when they arrived at the location Arya had designated: a gentle curve in the Ramr River that marked its farthest excursion eastward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon strained to look over Saphira’s neck as he searched for a glimpse of anyone below. The land appeared empty, save for a herd of wild oxen. When the animals caught sight of Saphira, they fled, lowing and kicking up plumes of dust. They and a few other, smaller animals scattered about the countryside were the only living creatures Eragon could sense. Disappointed, he shifted his gaze to the horizon but saw no sign of Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira landed on a slight rise fifty yards from the banks of the river. She sat, and Eragon sat with her, resting his back against her side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On the top of the rise was an outcropping of soft, slatelike rock. While they waited, Eragon amused himself by grinding a thumb-sized flake into the shape of an arrowhead. The stone was too soft for the arrowhead to be anything other than decorative, but he enjoyed the challenge. When he was satisfied with the simple, triangular point, he set it aside and began to grind a larger piece into a leaf-bladed dagger, similar to those the elves carried.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They did not have to wait as long as he first thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">An hour after their arrival, Saphira lifted her head from the ground and peered across the plains in the direction of the not-so-distant Hadarac Desert.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her body stiffened against his, and he felt a strange emotion within her: a sense of impending momentousness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Look</span>, she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Keeping hold of his half-finished dagger, he clambered to his feet and peered eastward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He saw nothing but grass, dirt, and a few lone, windswept trees between them and the horizon. He broadened his area of scrutiny but still saw nothing of interest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What</span>—he started to ask, then cut himself off as he looked up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">High in the eastern sky, he saw a wink of green fire, like an emerald glimmering in the sun. The point of light arced through the blue mantle of the heavens, approaching at a rapid pace, bright as a star at night.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon dropped the stone dagger and, without taking his eyes off the glittering spark, climbed onto Saphira’s back and strapped his legs into her saddle. He wanted to ask her what she thought the point of light was—to force her to put into words what he suspected—but he could not bring himself to speak any more than she could.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira held her position, although she unfolded her wings and, keeping them bent nearly in half, lifted them in preparation to take off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As it grew larger, the spark proliferated, dividing into a cluster of dozens, then hundreds, then thousands of tiny points of light. After a few minutes, the true shape of it became visible, and they saw that it was a dragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira could wait no longer. She uttered a resonant trumpet, leaped off the rise, and flapped downward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon clutched the neck spike in front of him as she ascended at a nearly vertical angle, desperate to intercept the other dragon as quickly as possible. Both he and she alternated between elation and a wariness born of too many battles. In their caution, it pleased them that they had the sun to their backs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira continued to climb until she was slightly above the green dragon, whereupon she leveled off and concentrated upon speed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Closer, Eragon saw that the dragon, while well built, still had some of the gangly look of youth—his limbs had yet to acquire the stocky weight of Glaedr’s or Thorn’s—and he was smaller than Saphira. <span>The</span> scales upon his sides and back were a dark forest green, while those upon his belly and the pads of his feet were lighter, with the smallest ones verging upon white. When against his body, his wings were the color of holly leaves, but when the light shone through them, they were the color of oak leaves in the spring.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the juncture between the dragon’s neck and back was a saddle much like Saphira’s, and on the saddle sat a figure that looked to be Arya, her dark hair streaming from her head. The sight filled Eragon’s heart with joy, and the emptiness he had labored under for so long vanished like the darkness of night before the rising sun.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the dragons swooped past each other, Saphira roared, and the other dragon roared in response. They turned and began to circle—as if chasing each other’s tails—Saphira still slightly above the green dragon, who made no attempt to climb above her. If he had, Eragon would have feared he was attempting to gain the advantage before attacking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He grinned and shouted into the wind. Arya shouted back and raised an arm. Then Eragon touched her mind, just to be sure, and he <span class="italic">knew</span> in an instant that it really was Arya, and that she and the dragon meant them no harm. He withdrew a moment later, for it would have been rude to prolong the mental contact without her consent; she would answer his questions when they spoke on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira and the green dragon roared again, and the green dragon lashed his whiplike tail; then they chased each other through the air until they reached the Ramr River. There Saphira took the lead and spiraled down until she landed upon the same rise where she and Eragon had been waiting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The green dragon landed a hundred feet away, settling into a low crouch while Arya freed herself from her saddle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon tore the straps off his legs and jumped to the ground, banging the sheath of Brisingr against his leg. He ran over to Arya, and she to him, and they met in the middle between the two dragons, who followed at a more sedate pace, their steps weighing heavily on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he drew near, Eragon saw that, in place of the leather strip that Arya usually wore to keep her hair back, a circlet of gold rested upon her brow. In the center of the circlet, a teardrop-shaped diamond flashed with light that came not from the sun but from within its own depths. At her waist hung a green-hilted sword in a green sheath, which he recognized as Támerlein, the same sword the elf lord Fiolr had offered him as a replacement for Zar’roc and that had once belonged to the Rider Arva. However, the hilt looked different than he remembered, lighter and more graceful, and the sheath appeared narrower.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took Eragon a moment to realize what the diadem meant. He looked at Arya with astonishment. “You!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Me,” she said, and inclined her head. “Atra esterní ono thelduin, Eragon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Atra du evarínya ono varda, Arya … Dröttning?” It did not escape him that she had chosen to greet him first.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Dröttning,” she confirmed. “My people chose to give me my mother’s title, and I chose to accept.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Above them, Saphira and the green dragon brought their heads close together and sniffed one another. Saphira was taller; the green dragon had to stretch his neck to reach her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As much as Eragon wanted to talk with Arya, he could not help staring at the green dragon. “And him?” he asked, motioning upward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya smiled, and then she surprised him by taking his hand and leading him forward. The green dragon snorted and lowered his head until it hung just above them, smoke and steam rising from the depths of his crimson nostrils.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eragon,” she said, and she placed his hand on the dragon’s warm snout, “this is Fírnen. Fírnen, this is Eragon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked up into one of Fírnen’s brilliant eyes; the bands of muscle within the dragon’s iris were the pale green and yellow of new blades of grass.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I am glad to meet you, Eragon-friend-Shadeslayer</span>, said Fírnen. His <span>mental</span> voice was deeper than Eragon expected, deeper even than that of Thorn or Glaedr or any of the Eldunarí from Vroengard. <span class="italic">My Rider has told me much about you</span>. And the dragon blinked once, with a small, sharp sound like a shell bouncing against a stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In Fírnen’s wide, sunlit mind, planked as it was with transparent shadows, Eragon could feel the dragon’s excitement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Wonder swept through Eragon, wonder that such a thing had come to pass. “I am glad to meet you as well, Fírnen-finiarel. I never thought that I would live to see you hatched and free of Galbatorix’s spells.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The emerald dragon snorted softly. He looked proud and full of energy, like a stag in fall. Then he returned his gaze to Saphira. Between the two of them, much passed; through Saphira, Eragon could feel the flow of thoughts, emotions, and sensations, slow at first, but then swelling into a torrent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya smiled slightly. “They seem to have taken to each other.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That they have.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A mutual understanding guiding them, he and Arya walked out from under Saphira and Fírnen, leaving the dragons to themselves. Saphira did not sit as she normally did, but remained crouched, as if she were about to spring onto a deer. Fírnen did the same. The tips of their tails twitched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya looked well: better, Eragon thought, than she had since their time together in Ellesméra. For lack of a more suitable word, he would have said she looked happy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Neither of them spoke for a while as they watched the dragons. Then Arya turned toward him and said, “I apologize for not contacting you sooner. You must think badly of me for ignoring you and Saphira for so long and for keeping such a secret as Fírnen.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Did you receive my letter?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I did.” To his surprise, she reached inside the front of her tunic and removed a square of battered parchment that, after a few seconds, he recognized. “I would have answered, but Fírnen had already hatched and I did not want to lie to you, even by omission.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why keep him hidden?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“With so many of Galbatorix’s servants still on the loose, and so few dragons remaining, I did not want to risk anyone finding out about Fírnen until he was large enough to defend himself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Did you really think a human could have snuck into Du Weldenvarden and killed him?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Stranger things have happened. With the dragons yet on the brink of extinction, it was not a risk worth taking. If I could, I would keep Fírnen in Du Weldenvarden for the next ten years, until he is so large that none would dare attack him. But he wished to leave, and I could not deny him. Besides, the time has come for me to meet with Nasuada and Orik in my new role.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon could feel Fírnen showing and telling Saphira about the first time he caught a deer in the elves’ forest. He knew that Arya was aware of the exchange as well, for he saw her lip twitch in response to an image of Fírnen hopping in pursuit of a startled doe after he tripped over a branch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And how long have you been queen?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Since a month after my return. Vanir doesn’t know, however. I ordered the information kept from him and our ambassador to the dwarves so that I could concentrate on raising Fírnen without having to worry about the affairs of state that otherwise would have fallen to me. … You might like to know: I raised him on the Crags of Tel’naeír, where Oromis lived with Glaedr. It seemed only right.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Silence fell between them. Then Eragon gestured at Arya’s diadem and at Fírnen and said, “How did all of this happen?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She smiled. “On our return to Ellesméra, I noticed that Fírnen was beginning to stir within his shell, but I thought nothing of it, as Saphira had often done the same. However, once we reached Du Weldenvarden and passed through its wards, he hatched. It was nearly evening, and I was carrying his egg in my lap, as I used to carry Saphira’s, and I was speaking to him, telling him of the world and reassuring him that he was safe, and then I felt the egg shake and …” She shivered and tossed her hair, a bright film of tears in <span>her</span> eyes. “The bond is everything I imagined it to be. When we touched … I always wanted to be a Dragon Rider, Eragon, so that I could protect my people and avenge my father’s death at the hands of Galbatorix and the Forsworn, but until I saw the first crack appear in Fírnen’s egg, I never allowed myself to believe that it might actually come to pass.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“When you touched, did—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes.” She lifted her left hand and showed him the silvery mark on the palm, the same as his own gedwëy ignasia. “It felt like …” She paused, searching for the words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Like ice-cold water that tingled and snapped,” he suggested.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Exactly like that.” Without seeming to notice, she crossed her arms, as if chilled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“So you returned to Ellesméra,” said Eragon. Now Saphira was telling Fírnen about when she and Eragon swam in Leona Lake while traveling to Dras-Leona with Brom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“So we returned to Ellesméra.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And you went to live on the Crags of Tel’naeír. But why become queen when you were already a Rider?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It was not my idea. Däthedr and the other elders of our race came to the house on the crags, and they asked me to take up my mother’s mantle. I refused, but they returned the next day, and the day after that, and every day for a week, and each time with new arguments for why I should accept the crown. In the end, they convinced me that it would be best for our people.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why you, though? Was it because you are Islanzadí’s daughter, or was it because you had become a Rider?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It was not just because Islanzadí was my mother, although that was part of it. Nor was it just because I was a Rider. Our politics are far more complicated than those of the humans or the dwarves, and choosing a new monarch is never easy. It involves obtaining consent from dozens of houses and families, as well as several of the older members of our race, and every choice they make is part of a subtle game that we have been playing amongst ourselves for <span>thousands</span> of years. … There were many reasons why they wanted me to become queen, not all of them obvious.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shifted, glancing between Saphira and Arya, unable to reconcile himself to Arya’s decision. “How can you be a Rider as well as a queen?” he asked. “The Riders aren’t supposed to support any one race above the others. It would be impossible for the other peoples of Alagaësia to trust us if we did. And how can you help rebuild our order and raise the next generation of dragons if you’re busy with your responsibilities in Ellesméra?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The world is not as it used to be,” she said. “Nor can the Riders remain apart as they once did. There are too few of us to stand alone, and it will be a long while before there are again enough of us to resume our former place. In any event, you have already sworn yourself to Nasuada and to Orik and Dûrgrimst Ingeitum, but not to us, not to the älfakyn. It is only right that we should have a Rider and dragon as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You know that Saphira and I would fight for the elves as much as for the dwarves or the humans,” he protested.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know, but others do not. Appearances matter, Eragon. You cannot change the fact that you have given your word to Nasuada and that you owe your loyalty to Orik’s clan. … My people have suffered greatly over the past hundred years, and though it may not be apparent to you, we are not what we once were. As the fortunes of the dragons have declined, so too have our own. Fewer children have been born to us, and our strength has waned. Also, some have said that our minds are no longer as sharp as they used to be, although it is difficult to prove one way or another.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The same is true of humans, or so Glaedr told us,” said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded. “He is right. Both of our races will take time to recover, and much will depend upon the return of the dragons. Moreover, even as Nasuada is needed to help guide the recovery of your race, so too do my own people need a leader. With Islanzadí dead, I felt obliged to take the task upon myself.” She touched her left shoulder, where her tattoo of the yawë glyph lay hidden. “I <span>pledged</span> myself to the service of my people when I was not much older than you. I cannot abandon them now, when their need is so great.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“They will always have need of you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And I will always answer their call,” she replied. “Do not worry; Fírnen and I shall not ignore our duties as a dragon and Rider. We will help you to patrol the land and settle what disputes we can, and wherever it seems best to raise the dragons, we shall visit and lend our assistance as often as we can, even if it be at the far southern end of the Spine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her words troubled Eragon, but he did his best to hide it. What she promised would not be possible if he and Saphira did as they had decided during the flight there. Although everything Arya had said helped confirm that the path they had chosen was the right one, he worried that it was a path that Arya and Fírnen would be unable to follow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He bowed his head then, accepting Arya’s decision to become queen and her right to make it. “I know you won’t neglect your responsibilities,” he said. “You never do.” He did not mean the statement unkindly; it was merely a statement of fact, and one for which he respected her. “And I understand why you did not contact us for so long. I probably would have done the same in your place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She smiled again. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He motioned toward her sword. “I take it Rhunön reworked Támerlein to better fit you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“She did, and she grumbled about it the whole while. She said the blade was perfect the way it was, but I am well pleased with the changes she made; the sword balances as it should in my hand now, and it feels no heavier than a switch.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they stood watching the dragons, Eragon tried to think of a way to tell Arya of their plans. Before he could, she said, “You and Saphira have been well?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We have.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What else of interest has occurred since you wrote?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon thought for a minute, then told her in brief about the attempts on Nasuada’s life, the uprisings in the north and the south, the birth of Roran and Katrina’s daughter, Roran’s ennoblement, and the list of treasures they had recovered from within the citadel. Lastly, he told of their return to Carvahall and their visit to Brom’s final resting place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">While he spoke, Saphira and Fírnen began to circle each other, the tips of their tails whipping back and forth faster than ever. They both had their jaws slightly open, baring their long white teeth, and they were breathing thickly through their mouths and uttering low, whining grunts, the likes of which Eragon had never heard before. It looked almost as if they were going to attack each other, which worried him, but the feeling from Saphira was not one of anger or fear. It was—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I want to test him</span>, said Saphira. She slapped her tail against the ground, causing Fírnen to pause.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Test him? How? For what</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">To find out if he has the iron in his bones and the fire in his belly to match me</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Are you sure</span>? he asked, understanding her intent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She again slapped her tail against the ground, and he felt her certainty and the strength of her desire. <span class="italic">I know everything about him—everything but this. Besides</span>—she displayed a flash of amusement—<span class="italic">it’s not as if dragons mate for life</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Very well. … But be careful</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He had barely finished speaking when Saphira lunged forward and bit Fírnen on his left flank, drawing blood and causing Fírnen to snarl and spring backward. The green dragon growled, appearing uncertain of himself, and retreated before Saphira as she prowled toward him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Saphira!</span> Chagrined, Eragon turned to Arya, intending to apologize.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya did not seem upset. To Fírnen, and to Eragon as well, she said, <span class="italic">If you want her to respect you, then you have to bite her in return</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She raised an eyebrow at Eragon, and he responded with a wry smile, understanding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Fírnen glanced at Arya and hesitated. He jumped back as Saphira snapped at him again. Then he roared and lifted his wings, as if to make himself appear larger, and he charged Saphira—and nipped her on a hind leg, sinking his teeth into her hide.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The pain Saphira felt was not pain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira and Fírnen resumed circling, growling and yowling with increasing volume. Then Fírnen jumped at her again. He landed on Saphira’s neck and bore her head to the ground, where he held her pinned and gave her a pair of playful bites at the base of her skull.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira did not struggle as fiercely as Eragon would have expected, and he guessed that she had allowed Fírnen to catch her, as it was not something even Thorn had managed to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The courting of dragons is no gentle affair,” he said to Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Did you expect soft words and tender caresses?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I suppose not.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a heave of her neck, Saphira threw Fírnen off and scrambled backward. She roared and clawed at the ground with her forefeet, and then Fírnen lifted his head toward the sky and loosed a rippling pennant of green fire twice the length of his own body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oh!” exclaimed Arya, sounding delighted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That’s the first time he has breathed fire!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira released a blast of fire herself—Eragon could feel the heat from over fifty feet away—and then she crouched and jumped into the sky, climbing straight upward. Fírnen followed an instant later.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stood with Arya as they watched the glittering dragons ascend into the heavens, spiraling around each other with flames streaming from their mouths. It was an awe-inspiring sight: savage and beautiful, and frightening. Eragon realized he was watching an ancient and elemental ritual, one that was part of the very fabric of nature itself and without which the land would wither and die.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His connection with Saphira grew tenuous as the distance <span>between</span> them increased, but he could still sense the heat of her passion, which darkened the edges of her vision and blotted out all thoughts save those driven by the instinctual need that all creatures, even the elves, are subject to.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The dragons shrank until at last they were no more than a pair of sparkling stars orbiting each other in the immensity of the sky. As far away as they were, Eragon still received a few flashes of thoughts and feelings from Saphira, and though he had experienced many such moments with the Eldunarí when they had shared their memories with him, his cheeks grew hot, as did the tips of his ears, and he found himself unable to look directly at Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She too seemed affected by the dragons’ emotions, although differently than he; she stared after Saphira and Fírnen with a faint smile, and her eyes shone brighter than usual, as if the sight of the two dragons filled her with pride and happiness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon let out a sigh, and then squatted and began to draw in the dirt with a stalk of grass.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well, that didn’t take long,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They remained that way for a number of minutes: she standing, he squatting, and all silence around them, save for the sound of the lonely wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last Eragon dared look up at Arya. She looked more beautiful than ever. But more than that, he saw his friend and ally; he saw the woman who had helped save him from Durza, who had fought alongside him against countless enemies, who had been imprisoned with him under Dras-Leona, and who, in the end, had killed Shruikan with the Dauthdaert. He remembered what she had told him about her life in Ellesméra when she was growing up, her difficult relationship with her mother, and the many reasons that had driven her to leave Du Weldenvarden and serve as an ambassador to the elves. He thought too of the hurts she had suffered: some from her mother, others from the isolation she had experienced among the humans <span>and</span> the dwarves, and still more when she had lost Faolin and then endured Durza’s tortures in Gil’ead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">All those things he thought of, and he felt a deep sense of connection with her, and a sadness too, and a sudden desire came upon him to capture what he saw.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">While Arya meditated upon the sky, Eragon looked about until he found a piece of the slatelike rock projecting from the earth. Making as little noise as possible, he dug out a slab with his fingers and brushed off the dirt until the stone was clean.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took him a moment to remember the spells he had once used, and then to modify them so as to extract the colors needed from the earth around him. Speaking the words silently, he incanted the spell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A stir of motion, like a swirl of muddy water, disturbed the surface of the tablet. Then colors—red, blue, green, yellow—bloomed on the slate and began to form lines and shapes even as they intermingled to form other, subtler shades. After a few seconds, an image of Arya appeared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once it was complete, he released the spell and studied the fairth. He was pleased with what he saw. The image seemed to be a true and honest representation of Arya, unlike the fairth he had made of her in Ellesméra. The one he held now had a depth that the other one had lacked. It was not a perfect image with regard to its composition, but he was proud that he had been able to capture so much of her character. In that one image, he had managed to sum up everything he knew about her, both the dark and the light.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He allowed himself to enjoy his sense of accomplishment for a moment more, then he threw the tablet off to the side, to break it against the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Kausta,” said Arya, and the tablet curved through the air and landed in her hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon opened his mouth, intending to explain or to apologize, but then he thought better of it and said nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Holding up the fairth, Arya stared at it with an intent gaze. Eragon watched her closely, wondering how she would react.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A long, tense minute passed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Arya lowered the fairth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stood and held out his hand for the tablet, but she made no move to return it. She appeared troubled, and his heart sank; the fairth had upset her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Looking him straight in the eye, she said in the ancient language, “Eragon, if you are willing, I would like to tell you my true name.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her offer left him dumbstruck. He nodded, overwhelmed, and, with great difficulty, managed to say, “I would be honored to hear it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya stepped forward and placed her lips close to his ear, and in a barely audible whisper she told him her name. As she spoke, the name rang within his mind, and with it came a rush of understanding. Some of the name he knew already, but there were many parts that surprised him, parts that he realized must have been difficult for Arya to share.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Arya stepped back and waited for his response, her expression studiously blank.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her name raised numerous questions for Eragon, but he knew that it was not the time to ask them. Rather, he needed to reassure Arya that he did not think any less highly of her because of what he had learned. Nor did he. If anything, her name had increased his regard, for it had shown him the true extent of her selflessness and her devotion to duty. He knew that if he reacted badly to her name—or even said the wrong thing without intending to—he could destroy their friendship.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He met Arya’s gaze full-on and said, also in the ancient language, “Your name … your name is a good name. You should be proud of who you are. Thank you for sharing it with me. I am glad to call you my friend, and I promise that I will always keep your name safe. … Will you, now, hear mine?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded. “I will. And I promise to remember and protect it for so long as it remains yours.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A sense of import came over Eragon. He knew there was no going back from what he was about to do, which he found both frightening and exhilarating. He moved forward and did as Arya had done, placing his lips by her ear and whispering his name as softly as he could. His whole being vibrated in recognition of the words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He backed away, suddenly apprehensive. How would she judge him? Fair or foul? For judge him she would; she could not help it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya released a long breath and looked at the sky for a while. When she turned to him again, her expression was softer than before. “You have a good name as well, Eragon,” she said in a low voice. “However, I do not think it is the name you had when you left Palancar Valley.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Nor do I think it is the name you bore during your time in Ellesméra. You’ve grown much since we first met.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’ve had to.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded. “You are still young, but you are no longer a child.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No. That I am not.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">More than ever, Eragon felt drawn to her. The exchange of names had formed a bond between them, but of what sort he was unsure, and his uncertainty left him with a sense of vulnerability. She had seen him with all his flaws and she had not recoiled, but had accepted him as he was, even as he accepted her. Moreover, she had seen in his name the depth of his feelings for her, and that too had not driven her away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He debated whether to say anything on the subject, but he could not let it go. After gathering up his courage, he said, “Arya, what is to become of us?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She hesitated, but he could see that his meaning was clear to her. Choosing her words with care, she said, “I don’t know. … Once, as you know, I would have said, ‘nothing,’ but … Again, you are still young, and humans often change their minds. In ten years, or even five, you may no longer feel as you now do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“My feelings won’t change,” he said with utter certainty.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She searched his face for a long, tense while. Then he saw a change in her eyes, and she said, “If they don’t, then … perhaps in time …” She put a hand on the side of his jaw. “You cannot ask more of me now. I do not want to make a mistake with you, Eragon. You are too important for that, both to me and to the whole of Alagaësia.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He tried to smile, but it came out more as a grimace. “But … we don’t have time,” he said, his voice choked. He felt sick to his stomach.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya’s brow furrowed, and she lowered her hand. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He stared at the ground, trying to think how to tell her. In the end, he just said it as simply as he could. He explained the difficulty he and Saphira had had in finding a safe place for the eggs and the Eldunarí, and then he explained Nasuada’s plan to form a group of magicians to keep watch over every human spellcaster.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He spent several minutes talking, and concluded by saying, “So Saphira and I have decided that the only thing we can do is leave Alagaësia and raise the dragons elsewhere, far away from other people. It’s what’s best for us, for the dragons, for the Riders, and all the other races of Alagaësia.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But the Eldunarí—” said Arya, appearing shocked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The Eldunarí can’t stay either. They would never be safe, not even in Ellesméra. As long as they remain in this land, there will be those who will try to steal them or use them to further their own designs. No, we need a place like Vroengard, a place where no one can find the dragons to hurt them and where the younglings and the wild dragons cannot hurt anyone themselves.” Eragon tried to smile again, but gave it up as hopeless. “That is why I said we have no time. Saphira and I intend to leave as soon as we can, and if you stay … I do not know if we will ever see each other again.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya glanced down at the fairth she still held, troubled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Would you give up your crown to come with us?” he asked, already knowing the answer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She lifted her gaze. “Would you give up charge of the eggs?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He shook his head. “No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a time, they were silent, listening to the wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How would you find candidates for the Riders?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We’ll leave a few eggs behind—with you, I suppose—and once they hatch, they and their Riders will come join us, and we’ll send you more eggs.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There must be another solution besides you and Saphira and every Eldunarí abandoning Alagaësia!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“If there were, we would take it, but there isn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What of the Eldunarí? What of Glaedr and Umaroth? Have you spoken to them of this? Do they agree?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We haven’t spoken to them, but they will agree. That I know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Are you sure about this, Eragon? Is it really the only way—to leave behind everything and everyone you have ever known?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s necessary, and our departure was always meant to be. Angela foretold it when she cast my fortune in Teirm, and I’ve had time to accustom myself to the idea.” He reached out and touched Arya on the cheek. “So, I ask again: will you come with us?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A film of tears appeared on her eyes, and she hugged the fairth against her chest. “I cannot.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He nodded and took his hand away. “Then … we will part ways.” Tears welled in his own eyes, and he struggled to retain his composure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But not yet,” she whispered. “We still have some time together. You will not leave immediately.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, not immediately.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And they stood next to each other, gazing into the sky and waiting for Saphira and Fírnen to return. After a while, her hand touched his, and he grasped it, and though it was a small comfort, it helped dull the ache in his heart.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_162"></div></body>
