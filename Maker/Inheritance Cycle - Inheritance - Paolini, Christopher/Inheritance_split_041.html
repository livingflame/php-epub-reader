<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON STRODE THROUGH</span></span> the darkened camp, his jaw set and his fists clenched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He had spent the last few hours in conference with Nasuada, Orik, Arya, Garzhvog, King Orrin, and their various advisers, discussing the day’s events and assessing the Varden’s current situation. Near the end of the meeting, they had contacted Queen Islanzadí to inform her that the Varden had captured Dras-Leona, as well as to tell her of Wyrden’s death.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon had not enjoyed explaining to the queen how one of her oldest and most powerful spellcasters had died, nor had the queen been pleased to receive the news. Her initial reaction had been one of such sadness, it surprised him; he had not thought she knew Wyrden that well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Talking with Islanzadí had left Eragon in a foul mood, for it had reinforced for him how random and unnecessary Wyrden’s death had been. <span class="italic">If I had been in the lead, I would have been the one impaled on those spikes</span>, he thought as he continued his search through the camp. <span class="italic">Or it could have been Arya</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira knew what he was up to, but she had decided to return to the space by his tent where she normally slept, for as she said, <span class="italic">If I go tromping up and down the rows of tents, I’ll keep the Varden awake, and they have earned their rest</span>. Their minds remained joined, though, and he knew if he needed her, she would be at his side within seconds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To preserve his night vision, Eragon avoided going near the bonfires and torches that burned before many of the tents, but he made sure to inspect each pool of light for his prey.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he hunted, it occurred to him that she might elude him <span>entirely</span>. His feelings for her were far from friendly, and that would allow her to sense his location and avoid him, if she wanted. Yet he did not think she was a coward. Despite her youth, she was one of the hardest people he had met, human, elf, or dwarf.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last he spotted Elva sitting in front of a small, nondescript tent, weaving a cat’s cradle by the light of a dying fire. Next to her sat the girl’s caretaker, Greta, a pair of long wooden knitting needles darting in her gnarled hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a moment, Eragon stood and watched. The old woman appeared more content than he had ever seen her, and he found himself reluctant to disturb her repose.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Elva said, “Do not lose your nerve now, Eragon. Not when you have come so far.” Her voice was curiously subdued, as if she had been crying, but when she looked up, her gaze was fierce and challenging.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Greta appeared startled when Eragon made his way into the light; she gathered up her yarn and needles and bowed, saying, “Greetings, Shadeslayer. May I offer you anything to eat or drink?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, thank you.” Eragon stopped before Elva and stared down at the small-framed girl. She stared back at him for a moment, then returned to weaving the loop of yarn between her fingers. Her violet eyes, he noted with a strange twist in his stomach, were the same color as the amethyst crystals the priests of Helgrind had used to kill Wyrden and imprison Arya and himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon knelt and grabbed the tangle of yarn about the middle, stopping Elva’s motion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know what you intend to say,” she stated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That may be,” he growled, “but I’m still going to say it. You killed Wyrden—you killed him as surely as if you had stabbed him yourself. If you had come with us, you could have warned him about the trap. You could have warned all of us. I watched Wyrden die, and I watched Arya tear half her hand off, because of <span class="italic">you</span>. Because of your anger. Because of your stubbornness. Because of your pride. … Hate me if you will, but don’t you dare make anyone else suffer for <span>it</span>. If you want the Varden to lose, then go join Galbatorix and be done with it. Well, is that what you want?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elva slowly shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then I don’t ever want to hear that you’ve refused to help Nasuada for no other reason than spite, else there will be a reckoning between you and me, Elva Farseer, and it’s not one you would win.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You could never defeat me,” she mumbled, her voice thick with emotion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You might be surprised. You have a valuable talent, Elva. The Varden needs your help, now more than ever. I don’t know how we’re going to defeat the king at Urû’baen, but if you stand with us—if you turn your skill against him—we might just have a chance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elva seemed to struggle with herself. Then she nodded, and Eragon saw that she was crying, tears overflowing from her eyes. He took no pleasure in her distress, but he felt a certain amount of satisfaction that his words had affected her so strongly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m sorry,” she whispered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He released the yarn and stood. “Your apologies cannot bring back Wyrden. Do better in the future, and perhaps you can atone for your mistake.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He nodded to the old woman Greta, who had remained silent throughout their exchange, and then he strode out of the light and back between the dark rows of tents.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You did well</span>, said Saphira. <span class="italic">She will act differently from now on, I think</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I hope so</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Upbraiding Elva had been an unusual experience for Eragon. He remembered when Brom and Garrow had chastised him for making mistakes, and to now find himself the one doing the chastising left him feeling … different … more mature.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And so the wheel turns</span>, he thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He took his time walking through the camp, enjoying the cool breeze wafting off the lake hidden within the shadows.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><img alt="images" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre29"/></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">After the capture of Dras-Leona, Nasuada had surprised everyone by insisting that the Varden not stay the night in the city. She had given no explanation for her decision, but Eragon suspected it was because the long delay at Dras-Leona had left her overeager to resume their journey to Urû’baen, and also because she had no desire to linger within the city, where any number of Galbatorix’s agents might be lurking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once the Varden had secured the streets, Nasuada detailed a number of warriors to remain in the city, under the command of Martland Redbeard. Then the Varden had left Dras-Leona and marched north, following the shore of the neighboring lake. Along the way, a constant stream of messengers had ridden back and forth between the Varden and Dras-Leona as Martland and Nasuada conferred about the numerous issues attending the governance of the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before the Varden had departed, Eragon, Saphira, and Blödhgarm’s spellcasters had returned to the ruined cathedral, retrieved Wyrden’s body, and searched for the belt of Beloth the Wise. It had taken only a few minutes for Saphira to pull aside the jumble of stone that blocked the entrance to the underground chambers and for Blödhgarm and the other elves to fetch Wyrden. But no matter how long they looked, and no matter what spells they used, they could not find the belt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elves had carried Wyrden on their shields out of the city, to a knoll next to a small creek. There they buried him while singing several aching laments in the ancient language—songs so sad that Eragon had wept without restraint and all the birds and animals within hearing had stopped and listened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The silver-haired elf woman Yaela had knelt by the side of the grave, taken an acorn from the pouch on her belt, and planted it directly above Wyrden’s chest. And then the twelve elves, Arya included, sang to the acorn, which took root and sprouted and grew <span>twining</span> upward, reaching and grasping toward the sky like a clutch of hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When the elves had finished, the leafy oak stood twenty feet high, with long strings of green flowers at the end of every branch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon had thought it was the nicest burial he had ever attended. He much preferred it to the dwarves’ practice of entombing their dead in hard, cold stone deep below the ground, and he liked the idea of one’s body providing food for a tree that might live for hundreds of years more. If he had to die, he decided that he would want an apple tree planted over him, so that his friends and family could eat the fruit born of his body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The concept had amused him tremendously, albeit in a rather morbid manner.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Besides searching the cathedral and retrieving Wyrden’s body, Eragon had also done one other thing of note in Dras-Leona after its capture. He had, with Nasuada’s approval, declared every slave within the city a free person, and he had personally gone to the manors and auction houses and cut loose many of the men, women, and children chained therein. The act had given him a great deal of satisfaction, and he hoped it would improve the lives of the people he had released.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he drew near his tent, he saw Arya waiting for him by the entrance. Eragon quickened his stride, but before he could greet her, someone called out: “Shadeslayer!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon turned and saw one of Nasuada’s pages trotting toward them. “Shadeslayer,” the boy repeated, somewhat out of breath, and bowed to Arya. “Lady Nasuada would like you to come to her tent an hour before dawn tomorrow morning, in order to confer with her. What shall I tell her, Lady Arya?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You may tell her I will be there when she wishes,” Arya replied, inclining her head slightly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The page bowed again, and then he spun around and ran off in the direction from which he had come.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s somewhat confusing, now that we’ve both killed a Shade,” Eragon observed with a faint grin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya smiled as well, the motion of her lips almost invisible in the darkness. “Would you rather I had let Varaug live?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No … no, not at all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I could have kept him as a slave, to do my bidding.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Now you’re teasing me,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She made a soft sound of amusement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Perhaps I should call you Princess instead—Princess Arya.” He said it again, enjoying the feel of the words in his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You should not call me that,” she said, more serious. “I am not a princess.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why not? Your mother is a queen. How can you not be a princess? Her title is <span class="italic">dröttning</span>, yours is <span class="italic">dröttningu</span>. One means ‘queen,’ and the other—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Does not mean ‘princess,’” she said. “Not exactly. There is no true equivalent in this language.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But if your mother were to die or step down from her throne, you would take her place as ruler of your people, wouldn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It is not that simple.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya did not seem inclined to explain further, so Eragon said, “Would you like to go in?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon pulled open the entrance to his tent, and Arya ducked inside. After a quick glance at Saphira—who lay curled up nearby, breathing heavily as she drifted off to sleep—Eragon followed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He went to the lantern that hung from the pole in the center of the tent and murmured, “Istalrí,” not using <span class="italic">brisingr</span>, so as to avoid igniting his sword. The resulting flame filled the interior with a warm, steady light that made the sparsely furnished army tent seem almost cozy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They sat, and Arya said, “I found this among Wyrden’s belongings, and I thought we might enjoy it together.” From the side <span>pocket</span> of her pants, she produced a carved wooden flask about the size of Eragon’s hand. She handed it to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon unstoppered the flask and sniffed at the mouth. He raised his eyebrows as he smelled the strong, sweet scent of liqueur.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Is it faelnirv?” he asked, naming the drink the elves made from elderberries and, Narí had claimed, moonbeams.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya laughed, and her voice rang like well-tempered steel. “It is, but Wyrden added something else to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The leaves of a plant that grows in the eastern part of Du Weldenvarden, along the shores of Röna Lake.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He frowned. “Do I know the name of this plant?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Probably, but it’s of no importance. Go on: drink. You’ll like it; I promise.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And she laughed again, which gave him pause. He had never seen her like this before. She seemed fey and reckless, and with a jolt of surprise, he realized she was already rather tipsy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hesitated, and he wondered if Glaedr was watching them. Then he lifted the flask to his lips and swallowed a mouthful of the faelnirv. The liqueur tasted different than he was accustomed to; it had a potent, musky flavor similar to the scent of a marten or a stoat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon grimaced and fought the urge to gag as the faelnirv burned a track down his throat. He took another, smaller sip and then passed the flask back to Arya, who drank as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The past day had been one of blood and horror. He had spent most of it fighting, killing, almost being killed himself, and he needed a release. … He needed to forget. The tension he felt was too deep-seated to ease with mental tricks alone. Something else was required. Something that came from outside of himself, even as the violence he had participated in had, for the most part, been external, not internal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Arya returned the flask to him, he downed a large quaff and then chuckled, unable to help himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya raised an eyebrow and regarded him with a thoughtful, if merry, expression. “What amuses you so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This … Us … The fact that we’re still alive, and <span class="italic">they</span>”—he waved his hand in the direction of Dras-Leona—“aren’t. Life amuses me, life and death.” A warm glow had already begun to form in his belly, and the tips of his ears had started to tingle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It is nice to be alive,” said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They continued to pass the flask back and forth until it was empty, at which point Eragon fit the stopper back into the mouth of the container—a task that required several attempts, for his fingers felt thick and clumsy, and the cot seemed to tilt underneath him, like the deck of a ship at sea.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He gave the empty flask to Arya, and as she took it, he grasped her hand, her right hand, and turned it toward the light. The skin was once more smooth and unblemished. No sign of her injury remained. “Blödhgarm healed you?” said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya nodded, and he released her. “Mostly. I have full use of my hand again.” She demonstrated by opening and closing it several times. “But there is still a patch of skin by the base of my thumb where I have no feeling.” She pointed with her left index finger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon reached out and lightly touched the area. “Here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Here,” she said, and moved his hand a bit to the right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And Blödhgarm wasn’t able do anything about it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She shook her head. “He tried a half-dozen spells, but the nerves refuse to rejoin.” She made a dismissive motion. “It’s of no consequence. I can still wield a sword and I can still draw a bow. That is all that matters.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hesitated, then said, “You know … how grateful I am for what you did—what you tried to do. I’m only sorry it left you with a permanent mark. If I could have prevented it somehow …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do not feel bad because of it. It’s impossible to go through life unscathed. Nor should you want to. By the hurts we accumulate, we measure both our follies and our accomplishments.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Angela said something similar about enemies—that if you didn’t make them, you were a coward or worse.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya nodded. “There is some truth to that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They continued to talk and laugh as the night wore on. Instead of weakening, the effects of the altered faelnirv continued to strengthen. A giddy haze settled over Eragon, and he noticed that the pockets of shadow in the tent looked as if they were swirling, and strange, flashing lights—like those he normally saw when he closed his eyes at night—floated across his field of vision. The tips of his ears were burning fever-hot, and the skin on his back itched and crawled, as if ants were marching over it. Also, certain sounds had acquired a peculiar intensity—the rhythmic chirping of the lakeside insects, for example, and the crackle of the torch outside his tent; they dominated his hearing to the point where he had difficulty singling out any other noise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Have I been poisoned</span>? he wondered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What is it?” asked Arya, noticing his alarm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He wet his mouth, which had become incredibly, painfully dry, and told her what he was experiencing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya laughed and leaned back, her eyes heavy and half-lidded. “That is as it should be. The sensations will wear off by dawn. Until then, relax and allow yourself to enjoy them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon struggled with himself for a moment as he debated whether to use a spell to clear his mind—if indeed he could—but then he decided to trust Arya and follow her advice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the world bent around him, it occurred to Eragon how dependent he was on his senses to determine what was real and what was not. He would have sworn that the flashing lights were there, though the rational part of his mind knew they were only faelnirv-induced apparitions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and Arya continued to talk, but their conversation became increasingly disjointed and incoherent. Nevertheless, Eragon was convinced that everything they said was of paramount importance, <span>although</span> he could not have explained why, nor could he remember what they had discussed only moments before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Some time later, Eragon heard the low, throaty sound of a reed pipe being played somewhere in the camp. At first he thought he was imagining the lilting tones, but then he saw Arya cock her head and turn in the direction of the music, as if she too had noticed it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Who was playing and why, Eragon could not tell. Nor did he care. It was as if the melody had sprung out of the blackness of the night itself, like a wind, lonely and forsaken.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He listened with his head tilted back and his eyelids nearly closed while fantastical images roiled within his mind, images that the faelnirv had induced but that the music shaped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As it progressed, the melody grew ever more wild, and what had been plaintive became urgent, and the notes trilled up and down in a manner so fast, so insistent, so complicated, so <span class="italic">alarming</span> that Eragon began to fear for the safety of the musician. To play that quickly and that skillfully seemed unnatural, even for an elf.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya laughed as the music reached a particularly fevered pitch, and she leaped to her feet and struck a pose, lifting her arms over her head. She stamped her foot against the ground and clapped her hands—once, twice, three times—and then, much to Eragon’s astonishment, she began to dance. Her movements were slow at first, almost languorous, but soon her pace increased until she matched the frenzied beat of the music.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The music soon peaked, then began to gradually subside as the piper restated and resolved the themes of the melody. But before the music ceased, a sudden itch made Eragon grab his right hand and scratch at the palm. At the same moment, he felt a twinge in the back of his mind as one of his wards flared to life, warning him of some danger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A second later, a dragon roared overhead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Cold fear stabbed through Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The roar did not belong to Saphira.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_81"></div></body>
