<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">THE WALK TO</span></span> the apple grove seemed shorter than it had the previous day. The gnarled trees were as ominous as ever, and Eragon kept his hand on Brisingr the whole time they were in the thicket.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As before, he and Saphira stopped at the edge of the tangled clearing that fronted the Rock of Kuthian. A flock of crows was perched upon the rough crag of stone, and at the sight of Saphira, they rose cawing into the air—as ill an omen as Eragon could imagine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For half an hour, Eragon stood fixed in place as he cast spell after spell, searching for any magic that could cause him, Saphira, or Glaedr harm. Woven throughout the clearing, the Rock of Kuthian, and—so far as he could tell—the rest of the island, he found a daunting array of enchantments. Some of the spells embedded in the depths of the earth had such power that it felt as if a great river of energy was flowing beneath his feet. Others were small and seemingly innocuous, sometimes affecting only a single flower or a single branch of a tree. More than half of the enchantments were dormant—because they lacked energy, no longer had an object upon which to act, or were waiting for a certain set of circumstances that had yet to arrive—and a number of the spells seemed to conflict, as if the Riders, or whoever had cast them, had sought to modify or negate earlier pieces of magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was unable to determine the purpose of most of the spells. No record remained of the words used to cast them, only the structures of energy that the long-dead magicians had so carefully created, and those structures were difficult, if not impossible, to interpret. Glaedr was of some help, as he was familiar with many of <span>the</span> older, larger pieces of magic that had been placed on Vroengard, but otherwise Eragon was forced to guess. Fortunately, even though he could not always figure out what a spell was supposed to do, he was often able to establish whether it would affect him, Saphira, or Glaedr. It was a complicated process that required complicated incantations, though, and it took him another hour to examine all the spells.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">What most worried him—and Glaedr as well—were the spells that they might not have been able to detect. Ferreting out other magicians’ enchantments grew vastly more difficult if they had tried to hide their work.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last, when Eragon was as confident as he could be that there were no traps on or around the Rock of Kuthian, he and Saphira walked across the clearing to the base of the jagged, lichen-covered spire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon tilted his head back and looked toward the top of the formation. It seemed incredibly far away. He saw nothing unusual about the stone, nor did Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Let us say our names and be done with it</span>, she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon sent a questioning thought to Glaedr, and the dragon responded: <span class="italic">She is right. There is no reason to delay. Speak your name, and Saphira and I shall do likewise</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Feeling nervous, Eragon clenched his hands twice, then unslung his shield from his back, drew Brisingr, and dropped into a crouch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“My name,” he said in a loud, clear voice, “is Eragon Shadeslayer, son of Brom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">My name is Saphira Bjartskular, daughter of Vervada</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And mine Glaedr Eldunarí, son of Nithring, she of the long tail</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They waited.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Off in the distance, the crows cawed, as if mocking them. Unease stirred within Eragon, but he ignored it. He had not really expected opening the vault to be quite so simple.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Try again, but this time say your piece in the ancient language</span>, advised Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So Eragon said, “Nam iet er Eragon Sundavar-Vergandí, sönr abr Brom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And then Saphira repeated her name and lineage in the ancient language, as did Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again nothing happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s unease deepened. If their trip had been in vain … No, it did not bear thinking about. Not yet. <span class="italic">Maybe all of our names have to be uttered out loud</span>, he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">How</span>? asked Saphira. <span class="italic">Am I supposed to roar at the stone? And what of Glaedr</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I can say your names for you</span>, said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It seems unlikely that is what is required, but we may as well attempt it</span>, said Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">In this or the ancient language</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The ancient language, I would think, but try both to be certain</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Two times then Eragon recited their names, yet the stone remained as stolid and unchanging as ever. Finally, frustrated, he said, <span class="italic">Maybe we’re in the wrong place; maybe the entrance to the Vault of Souls is on the other side of the stone. Or maybe it’s on the very top</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If that were the case, wouldn’t the directions contained within</span> Domia abr Wyrda <span class="italic">have mentioned it</span>? asked Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon lowered his shield. <span class="italic">When are riddles ever easy to understand</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What if only you are supposed to give your name</span>? Saphira said to Eragon. <span class="italic">Did not Solembum say, “… when all seems lost and your power is insufficient, go to the Rock of Kuthian and speak your name to open the Vault of Souls</span>.” Your <span class="italic">name, Eragon, not mine or Glaedr’s</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon frowned. <span class="italic">It’s possible, I suppose. But if only my name is needed, then perhaps I have to be by myself when I say it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a growl, Saphira leaped into the air, ruffling Eragon’s hair and battering the plants in the clearing with the wind from her wings. <span class="italic">Then try, and be quick about it!</span> she said as she flew east, away from the rock.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When she was a quarter mile away, Eragon looked back at the uneven surface of the rock, once more raised his shield, and once <span>more</span> pronounced his name, first in his own tongue and then in that of the elves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">No door or passageway revealed itself. No cracks or fissures appeared within the stone. No symbols traced themselves upon its surface. In every respect, the towering spire seemed to be nothing more than a solid piece of granite, devoid of any secrets.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Saphira!</span> Eragon shouted with his mind. Then he swore and stalked back and forth within the clearing, kicking at loose stones and branches.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He returned to the base of the rock as Saphira swooped down to the clearing. The talons on her hind legs cut deep gouges in the soft earth as she landed, back-flapping to slow herself to a halt. Leaves and blades of grass swirled about her, as if caught in a whirlwind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once she had dropped to all fours and folded her wings, Glaedr said, <span class="italic">I take it you did not meet with success</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No</span>, snapped Eragon, and he glared at the spire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The old dragon seemed to sigh. <span class="italic">I was afraid this would be the case. There is only one explanation</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">That Solembum lied to us? That he sent us off on a wild chase so that Galbatorix could destroy the Varden while we’re gone</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No. That in order to open this … this</span> …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Vault of Souls</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, this vault he told you about—that in order to open it, we must speak our true names</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The words fell between them like weighty stones. For a time, none of them spoke. The thought intimidated Eragon, and he was reluctant to address it, as if doing so would somehow make the situation worse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">But if it’s a trap</span>—said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then it is a most devilish trap</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">The question you must decide is this: do you trust Solembum? For to proceed is to risk more than our lives; it is to risk our freedom. If you do trust him, can you be honest enough with yourselves to discover your true names, and quickly too? And are you willing to live with that knowledge, however unpleasant <span>it</span> might be? Because if not, then we should leave this very moment. I have changed since Oromis’s death, but I know who I am. But do you, Saphira? Do you, Eragon? Can you really tell me what it is that makes you the dragon and Rider you are</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Dismay crept through Eragon as he gazed up at the Rock of Kuthian.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Who</span> am <span class="italic">I</span>? he wondered.</span></p>
