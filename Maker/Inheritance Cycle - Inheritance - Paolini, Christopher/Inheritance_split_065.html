<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ON THE FLIGHT</span></span> from Vroengard to Urû’baen, Saphira did not have to battle her way through a storm and was fortunate enough to have a tailwind to speed her progress, for the Eldunarí told her where to find the fast-moving stream of air, which they said blew nearly every day of the year. Also, the Eldunarí fed her a constant supply of energy, so she never flagged or grew tired.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As a result, the city first came into sight on the horizon a mere two days after they departed the island.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Twice during the trip, when the sun was at its brightest, Eragon thought he glimpsed the entrance to the pocket of space where the Eldunarí floated hidden behind Saphira. It appeared as a single dark point, so small that he could not keep his eyes fixed upon it for more than a second. At first he assumed it was a mote of dust, but then he noticed that the point never varied in its distance from Saphira, and when he saw it, it was always in the same place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they flew, the dragons had, through Umaroth, poured memory after memory into Eragon and Saphira: a cascade of experiences—battles won and battles lost, loves, hates, spells, events witnessed throughout the land, regrets, realizations, and ponderings concerning the workings of the world. The dragons possessed thousands of years of knowledge, and they seemed driven to share every last bit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It’s too much!</span> Eragon had protested. <span class="italic">We can’t remember it all, much less understand it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No</span>, said Umaroth. <span class="italic">But you can remember some, and it may be that some will be what you need to defeat Galbatorix. Now, let us continue</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The torrent of information was overwhelming; at times Eragon felt as if he was forgetting who he was, for the dragons’ memories far <span>outnumbered</span> his own. When that happened, he would separate his mind from theirs and repeat his true name to himself until he again felt secure in his identity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The things he and Saphira learned amazed and troubled him and oftentimes caused him to question his own beliefs. But he never had time to dwell on such thoughts, for there was always another memory to take their place. It would, he knew, take him years to begin to make sense of what the dragons were showing them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The more he learned about the dragons, the more he regarded them with awe. Those who had lived for hundreds of years were strange in their ways of thinking, and the oldest were as different from Glaedr and Saphira as Glaedr and Saphira were from the Fanghur in the Beor Mountains. Interacting with these elders was confusing and unsettling; they made jumps, associations, and comparisons that seemed meaningless but that Eragon knew made sense at some deep level. He was rarely able to figure out what they were trying to say, and the ancient dragons did not deign to explain themselves in terms that he could understand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a while, he realized that they <span class="italic">couldn’t</span> express themselves in any other way. Over the centuries, their minds had changed; what was simple and straightforward for him often seemed complicated for them, and the same was true in reverse. Listening to their thoughts, he felt, must be like listening to the thoughts of a god.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he made that particular observation, Saphira snorted and said to him, <span class="italic">There is a difference</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Unlike gods, we take part in the events of the world</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Perhaps the gods choose to act without being seen</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then what good are they</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You believe that dragons are better than gods</span>? he asked, amused.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">When we are fully grown, yes. What creature is greater than us? Even Galbatorix depends upon us for his strength</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What of the Nïdhwal</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She sniffed. <span class="italic">We can swim, but they cannot fly</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The very oldest of the Eldunarí, a dragon by the name of Valdr—which meant “ruler” in the ancient language—spoke to them directly only once. From him, they received a vision of beams of light turning into waves of sand, as well as a disconcerting sense that everything that seemed solid was mostly empty space. Then Valdr showed them a nest of sleeping starlings, and Eragon could feel their dreams flickering in their minds, fast as the blink of an eye. At first Valdr’s emotion was one of contempt—the starlings’ dreams seemed tiny, petty, and inconsequential—but then his mood changed and became warm and sympathetic, and even the smallest of the starlings’ concerns grew in importance until it seemed equal to the worries of kings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Valdr lingered over the vision, as if to make sure that Eragon and Saphira would remember it amid all the other memories. Yet neither of them was certain what the dragon was trying to say, and Valdr refused to explain himself further.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">When at last Urû’baen came into view, the Eldunarí ceased sharing their memories with Eragon and Saphira, and Umaroth said, <span class="italic">Now you would be best served by studying the lair of our foe</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">This they did as Saphira descended toward the ground over the course of many leagues. What they saw did not encourage either of them, nor did their moods improve when Glaedr said, <span class="italic">Galbatorix has built much since he drove us from this place. The walls were not so thick nor so tall in our day</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To which Umaroth added: <span class="italic">Nor was Ilirea this heavily fortified during the war between our kind and the elves. The traitor has burrowed deep and piled a mountain of stone about his hole. He will not come out of his own accord, I think. He is like a badger who has retreated into his den and who will bloody the nose of anyone who tries to dig him out</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A mile southwest from the walled shelf and the city beneath lay the Varden’s camp. It was significantly larger than Eragon remembered, which puzzled him until he realized that Queen Islanzadí and her army must have finally joined forces with the Varden. He gave <span>a</span> small sigh of relief. Even Galbatorix was wary of the might of the elves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he and Saphira were a league or so from the tents, the Eldunarí helped Eragon extend the range of his thoughts until he was able to feel the minds of the men, dwarves, elves, and Urgals gathered within the camp. His touch was too light for anyone to notice unless they were deliberately watching for it, and the moment he located the distinctive strain of wild music that marked Blödhgarm’s thoughts, he narrowed his focus to the elf alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Blödhgarm</span>, he said. <span class="italic">It is I, Eragon</span>. The more formal phrasing seemed natural to him after so long spent reliving experiences from ages past.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Shadeslayer! Are you safe? Your mind feels most strange. Is Saphira with you? Is she hurt? Has something happened to Glaedr</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">They are both well, as am I</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then</span>—Blödhgarm’s confusion was evident.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Cutting him off, Eragon said, <span class="italic">We’re not far, but I’ve hidden us from sight for the time being. Is the illusion of Saphira and me still visible to those below</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, Shadeslayer. We have Saphira circling the tents a mile above. Sometimes we hide her in a bank of clouds, or we make it seem as if you and she have gone off on patrol, but we dare not let Galbatorix think you’ve left for long. We will make your images fly away now, so that you may rejoin us without arousing suspicion</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No. Rather, wait and maintain your spells for a while longer</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Shadeslayer</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We are not returning directly to the camp</span>. Eragon glanced at the ground. <span class="italic">There is a small hill perhaps two miles to the southeast. Do you know it</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, I can see it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Saphira will land behind it. Have Arya, Orik, Jörmundur, Roran, Queen Islanzadí, and King Orrin join us there, but make sure they do not leave the camp all at once. If you could help hide them, that would be best. You should come as well</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">As you wish. … Shadeslayer, what did you find on</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No! Do not ask me. It would be dangerous to think of it here. Come and I will tell you, but I do not want to blare the answer where others might be listening</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I understand. We will meet with you as quickly as we can, but it may take some time to stagger our departures correctly</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Of course. I trust you’ll do what’s best</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon severed their connection and leaned back in the saddle. He smiled slightly as he imagined Blödhgarm’s expression when he learned of the Eldunarí.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a whirl of wind, Saphira landed in the hollow by the base of the hill, startling a flock of nearby sheep, who scurried away while uttering plaintive bleats.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As she folded her wings, Saphira looked after the sheep and said, <span class="italic">It would be easy to catch them, since they cannot see me</span>. She licked her chops.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes, but where would the sport be in that?” Eragon asked, loosening the straps around his legs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Sport does not fill your belly</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, but then you aren’t hungry, are you?” The energy from the Eldunarí, though insubstantial, had suppressed her desire to eat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She released a great amount of air in what seemed to be a sigh. <span class="italic">No, not really</span>. …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">While they waited, Eragon stretched his sore limbs, then ate a light lunch from what remained of his provisions. He knew that Saphira was sprawled her full, sinuous length on the ground next to him, though he could not see her. Her presence was betrayed only by the shadowed impression her body left upon the flattened stalks of grass, like a strangely shaped hollow. He was not sure why, but the sight amused him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he ate, he gazed out at the pleasant fields around the hill, watching the stir of air in the stalks of wheat and barley. Long, low walls of piled stone separated the fields; it must have taken the local farmers hundreds of years to dig so many stones out of the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">At least that wasn’t a problem we had in Palancar Valley</span>, he thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A moment later, one of the dragons’ memories returned to him, and he knew exactly how old the stone walls were; they dated to the time when humans had come to live in the ruins of Ilirea, after the elves had defeated King Palancar’s warriors. He could see, as if he had been there, lines of men, women, and children combing over freshly tilled fields and carrying the rocks they found over to where the walls would be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a time, Eragon allowed the memory to fade away, and then he opened his mind to the ebb and flow of energy around them. He listened to the thoughts of the mice in the grass and the worms in the earth and the birds that fluttered past overhead. It was a slightly risky thing to do, for he could end up alerting any nearby enemy spellcasters to their presence, but he preferred to know who and what was close, so that no one could attack them by surprise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Thus he sensed the approach of Arya, Blödhgarm, and Queen Islanzadí, and he was not alarmed when the shadows of their footsteps moved toward him from around the western side of the hill.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The air rippled like water, and then the three elves appeared before him. Queen Islanzadí stood in the lead, as regal as ever. She was garbed in a golden corselet of scale armor, with a jeweled helm upon her head and her red, white-trimmed cape clasped about her shoulders. A long, slim sword hung from her narrow waist. She carried a tall, white-bladed spear in one hand and a shield shaped like a birch leaf—its edges were even serrated like a leaf—in the other.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya, too, was clad in fine armor. She had exchanged her usual dark clothes for a corselet like her mother’s—although Arya’s was the gray of bare steel, not gold—and she wore a helm decorated with embossed knotwork upon the brow and nosepiece and a pair of stylized eagle wings that swept back from her temples. Compared with the splendor of Islanzadí’s raiment, Arya’s was somber, but all the more deadly because of it. Together, mother and daughter were like a pair of matched blades, where one was adorned for display and one fitted for combat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Like the two women, Blödhgarm wore a shirt of scale armor, but his head was bare, and he carried no weapon besides a small knife on his belt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Show yourself, Eragon Shadeslayer,” said Islanzadí, looking toward the spot where he stood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon released the spell that concealed him and Saphira, then bowed to the elf queen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She ran her dark eyes over him, studying him as if he were a prize draft horse. Unlike before, he had no difficulty holding her gaze. After a few seconds, the queen said, “You have improved, Shadeslayer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He gave a second, shorter bow. “Thank you, Your Majesty.” As always, the sound of her voice sent a thrill through him. It seemed to hum with magic and music, as if every word were part of an epic poem. “Such a compliment means much from one so wise and fair as you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Islanzadí laughed, showing her long teeth, and the hill and the fields rang with her mirth. “And you have grown eloquent as well! You did not tell me he had become so well spoken, Arya!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A faint smile touched Arya’s face. “He is still learning.” Then to Eragon, she said, “It is good to see you safely returned.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elves plied him, Saphira, and Glaedr with numerous questions, but the three of them refused to provide answers until the others had arrived. Still, Eragon thought that the elves sensed something of the Eldunarí, for he noticed that they sometimes glanced in the direction of the hearts of hearts, although they seemed not to realize it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik was the next to join them. He rode from the south on a shaggy pony that was lathered and panting. “Ho, Eragon! Ho, Saphira!” the dwarf king cried, raising a fist. He slid down from his exhausted mount, stomped over, and pulled Eragon into a rough embrace, pounding him on the back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When they had finished greeting each other—and Orik had <span>given</span> Saphira a rub on her nose, which made her hum—Eragon asked, “Where are your guards?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik gestured over his shoulder. “Braiding their beards by a farmhouse a mile west of here, and none too happy about it, I dare say. I’d trust every last one of them—they’re clanmates of mine—but Blödhgarm said I should best come alone, so alone I’ve come. Now tell me, why this secrecy? What did you discover on Vroengard?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’ll have to wait for the rest of our council to find out,” said Eragon. “But I am glad to see you again.” And he clapped Orik on the shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran arrived on foot soon afterward, looking grim and dusty. He gripped Eragon’s arm and welcomed him, then pulled him aside and said, “Can you stop them from hearing us?” He motioned with his chin toward Orik and the elves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took Eragon only a few seconds to cast a spell that shielded them from listeners. “Done.” At the same time, he separated his mind from Glaedr and the other Eldunarí, although not from Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran nodded and looked off over the fields. “I had some words with King Orrin while you were gone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Words? How so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He was being a fool, and I told him so.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I take it he didn’t react very kindly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You could say that. He tried to stab me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He <span class="italic">what</span>?!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I managed to knock his sword out of his hand before he could land a blow, but if he had had his way, he would have killed me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Orrin?” Eragon had trouble imagining the king doing any such thing. “Did you hurt him badly?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For the first time, Roran smiled: a brief expression that quickly vanished under his beard. “I scared him, which might be worse.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon grunted and clenched the pommel of Brisingr. He realized that he and Roran were mirroring each other’s posture; they both <span>had</span> their hands on their weapons, and they both stood with their weight on the opposite leg. “Who else knows of this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Jörmundur—he was there—and whomever Orrin has told.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Frowning, Eragon began to pace back and forth as he tried to decide what to do. “The timing of this couldn’t be worse.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know. I wouldn’t have been so blunt with Orrin, but he was about to send ‘royal greetings’ to Galbatorix and other such nonsense. He would have put us all in danger. I couldn’t allow that to happen. You would have done the same.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Maybe so, but this just makes things all the more difficult. I’m the leader of the Varden now. An attack on you or any of the other warriors under my command is the same as an attack on me. Orrin knows that, and he knows we’re of the same blood. He might as well have thrown a gauntlet in my face.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He was drunk,” said Roran. “I’m not sure he was thinking of that when he drew his sword.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon saw Arya and Blödhgarm giving him curious glances. He stopped pacing and turned his back to them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m worried about Katrina,” Roran added. “If Orrin is angry enough, he might send his men after me or her. Either way, she could get hurt. Jörmundur already posted a guard at our tent, but that’s not enough protection.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shook his head. “Orrin wouldn’t dare hurt her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No? He can’t harm you, and he doesn’t have the stomach to confront me directly, so what does that leave? An ambush. Knives in the dark. Killing Katrina would be an easy way for Orrin to have his revenge.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I doubt that Orrin would resort to knives in the dark—or harming Katrina.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You can’t say for sure, though.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon thought for a moment. “I’ll place some spells on Katrina to keep her safe, and I’ll let Orrin know that I’ve placed them. That should put a stop to any plans he might have.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The tension in Roran seemed to drain away. “I’d appreciate that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’ll give you some new wards as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, save your strength. I can take care of myself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon insisted, but Roran kept refusing. Finally, Eragon said, “Blast it! Listen to me. We’re about to go into battle against Galbatorix’s men. You have to have <span class="italic">some</span> protection, if only against magic. I’m going to give you wards whether you like it or not, so you might as well smile and thank me for them!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran glowered at him, then he grunted and raised his hands. “Fine, as you wish. You never did know when it was sensible to give up.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oh, and you do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A chuckle came from within the depths of Roran’s beard. “I suppose not. I guess it runs in the family.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mmh. Between Brom and Garrow, I don’t know who was the more stubborn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Father was,” said Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eh … Brom was as—No, you’re right. It was Garrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They exchanged grins, remembering their life on the farm. Then Roran shifted his stance and gave Eragon an odd, sideways look. “You seem different than before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do I?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes, you do. You seem more sure of yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Perhaps it’s because I understand myself better than I once did.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To that, Roran had no answer.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Half an hour later, Jörmundur and King Orrin rode up together. Eragon greeted Orrin as politely as ever, but Orrin responded with a curt reply and avoided his gaze. Even from a distance of several feet, Eragon could smell wine on his breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once they were all assembled before Saphira, Eragon began. First, he had everyone swear oaths of secrecy in the ancient language. Then he explained the concept of an Eldunarí to Orik, Roran, Jörmundur, and Orrin, and he recounted a brief history of the dragons’ gemlike hearts with the Riders and Galbatorix.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elves appeared uneasy with Eragon’s willingness to discuss the Eldunarí before the others, but none protested, which pleased him. He had earned that much trust, at least. Orik, Roran, and Jörmundur reacted with surprise, disbelief, and dozens of questions. Roran in particular acquired a sharp gleam in his eye, as if the information had given him a host of new ideas on how to kill Galbatorix.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Throughout, Orrin was surly and remained stridently unconvinced of the existence of the Eldunarí. In the end, the only thing that quelled his doubts was when Eragon removed Glaedr’s heart of hearts from the saddlebags and introduced the dragon to the four of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The awe they displayed at meeting Glaedr gratified Eragon. Even Orrin seemed impressed, although after exchanging a few words with Glaedr, he turned on Eragon and said, “Did Nasuada know of this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes. I told her at Feinster.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Eragon expected, the admission displeased Orrin. “So once again the two of you chose to ignore me. Without the support of my men and the food of my nation, the Varden would have had no hope of confronting the Empire. I’m the sovereign ruler of one of only four countries in Alagaësia, my army makes up a goodly portion of our forces, and yet neither of you deemed it appropriate to inform me of this!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before Eragon could respond, Orik stepped forward. “They did not tell me about it either, Orrin,” the dwarf king rumbled. “And mine people have helped the Varden for longer than yours. You should not take offense. Eragon and Nasuada did what they thought was best for our cause; they meant no disrespect.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orrin scowled and looked as if he was going to continue arguing, but Glaedr preempted him by saying, <span class="italic">They did as I asked, King of the Surdans. The Eldunarí are the greatest secret of our race, and we do not share it lightly with others, even kings</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then why have you chosen to do so now?” demanded Orrin. “You could have gone into battle without ever revealing yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In answer, Eragon recounted the story of their trip to Vroengard, including their encounter with the storm at sea and the sight they had witnessed at the very top of the clouds. Arya and Blödhgarm seemed the most interested in that part of his story, whereas Orik was the most uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Barzûl, but that sounds a nasty experience,” he said. “It makes me shiver just to think of it. The ground is the proper place for a dwarf, not the sky.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I agree</span>, said Saphira, which caused Orik to scowl suspiciously and twist the braided ends of his beard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Resuming his tale, Eragon told of how he, Saphira, and Glaedr had entered the Vault of Souls, though he refrained from divulging that this had required their true names. And when he at last revealed what the vault had contained, there was a moment of shocked silence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon said, “Open your minds.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A moment later, the sound of whispering voices seemed to fill the air, and Eragon felt the presence of Umaroth and the other hidden dragons surround them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elves staggered, and Arya dropped to one knee, pressing a hand to the side of her head as if she had been struck. Orik uttered a cry and looked about, wild-eyed, while Roran, Jörmundur, and Orrin stood dumbfounded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Queen Islanzadí knelt, adopting a pose much like her daughter’s. In his mind, Eragon heard her speaking to the dragons, greeting many by name and welcoming them as old friends. Blödhgarm did likewise, and for several minutes a flurry of thoughts passed between the dragons and those gathered at the base of the hill.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The mental cacophony was so great, Eragon shielded himself from it and retreated to sit on one of Saphira’s forelegs while he waited for the noise to subside. The elves seemed most affected by the revelation: Blödhgarm stared into the air with an expression of joy and wonder, while Arya continued to kneel. Eragon thought he saw a line of tears on each of her cheeks. Islanzadí beamed with <span>a</span> triumphant radiance, and for the first time since he had met her, Eragon thought she seemed truly happy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik shook himself then and broke from his reverie. Looking over at Eragon, he said, “By Morgothal’s hammer, this puts a new twist on things! With their help, we might actually be able to kill Galbatorix!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You didn’t think we could before?” Eragon asked mildly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Of course I did. Only not so much as I do now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran shook himself, as if waking from a dream. “I didn’t. … I knew that you and the elves would fight as hard as you could, but I didn’t believe you could win.” He met Eragon’s gaze. “Galbatorix has defeated so many Riders, and you’re but one, and not that old. It didn’t seem possible.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Now, though …” A wolfish look came into Roran’s eyes. “Now we have a chance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye,” said Jörmundur. “And just think: we no longer have to worry so much about Murtagh. He’s no match for you and the dragons combined.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon drummed his heels against Saphira’s leg and did not answer. He had other ideas on that front. Besides, he did not like to consider having to kill Murtagh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Orrin spoke up. “Umaroth says that you have devised a battle plan. Do you intend to share it with us, <span class="italic">Shadeslayer</span>?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would like to hear it as well,” said Islanzadí in a kinder tone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And I,” said Orik.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stared at them for a moment, then nodded. To Islanzadí, he said, “Is your army ready to fight?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It is. Long we have waited for our vengeance; we need wait no longer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And ours?” Eragon asked, directing his words toward Orrin, Jörmundur, and Orik.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mine knurlan are eager for battle,” proclaimed Orik.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Jörmundur glanced at King Orrin. “Our men are tired and hungry, but their will is unbroken.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The Urgals too?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Them too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then we attack.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“When?” demanded Orrin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“At first light.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a moment, no one spoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran broke the silence. “Easy to say, hard to do. How?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon explained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he finished, there was another silence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran squatted and began to draw in the dirt with the tip of a finger. “It’s risky.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But bold,” said Orik. “Very bold.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There are no safe paths anymore,” said Eragon. “If we can catch Galbatorix unprepared, even a bit, it might be enough to tip the scales.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Jörmundur rubbed his chin. “Why not kill Murtagh first? That’s the part I don’t understand. Why not finish him and Thorn while we have the chance?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Because,” Eragon replied, “then Galbatorix would know of <span class="italic">them</span>.” And he motioned toward where the hidden Eldunarí floated. “We would lose the advantage of surprise.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What of the child?” Orrin asked harshly. “What makes you think that she will accommodate you? She hasn’t before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This time she will,” Eragon promised, more confidently than he felt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king grunted, unconvinced.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Islanzadí said, “Eragon, it is a great and terrible thing you propose. Are you willing to do this? I ask not because I doubt your dedication or your bravery, but because this is something to be undertaken only after much consideration. So I ask you: are you willing to do this, even knowing what the cost may be?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon did not rise, but he allowed a bit of steel to enter his voice. “I am. It must be done, and we are the ones to whom the task has fallen. Whatever the cost, we cannot turn away now.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As a sign of her agreement, Saphira opened her jaws a few inches and then snapped them shut, punctuating the end of his sentence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Islanzadí turned her face toward the sky. “And do you and those you speak for approve of this, Umaroth-elda?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We do</span>, replied the white dragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then here we go,” Roran murmured.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_132"></div></body>
