<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">THE THIRD TIME</span></span> the man visited her, Nasuada was sleeping. The sound of the door banging open caused her to jolt awake, heart pounding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took her a few seconds to remember where she was. When she did, she frowned and blinked, trying to clear her eyes. She wished she could rub them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her frown deepened as she looked down her body and saw that there was still a small damp spot on her shift where a drop of watered wine had fallen during her meal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why has he returned so soon</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her heart sank as the man walked past her carrying a large copper brazier full of charcoal, which he set upon its legs a few feet away from the slab. Resting in the charcoal were three long irons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The time she had dreaded had finally arrived.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She tried to catch his eye, but the man refused to look at her as he took flint and steel from a pouch on his belt and lit a nest of shredded tinder in the center of the brazier. As sparks smoldered and spread, the tinder glowed like a ball of red-hot wires. The man bent, puckered his lips, and blew on the incipient fire, gentle as a mother kissing her child, and the sparks sprang into lambent flames.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For several minutes, he tended the fire, building a bed of coals several inches thick, the smoke rising to a grate far above. She watched with morbid fascination, unable to tear her gaze away, despite what she knew awaited her. Neither he nor she spoke; it was as if they were both too ashamed of what was about to take place for either to acknowledge it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He blew on the coals again, then turned as if to approach her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Don’t give in</span>, she told herself, stiffening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She clenched her fists and held her breath as the man walked toward her … closer … closer …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A feather-like touch of wind brushed her face as he strode past her, and she listened to his footsteps dwindle into silence as he climbed the stairs and left the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A faint gasp escaped her as she relaxed slightly. Like lodestones, the bright coals drew her gaze back toward them. A dull, rust-colored glow was creeping up the iron rods that stuck out of the brazier.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She wet her mouth and thought how nice a drink of water would be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">One of the coals jumped and split in two, but otherwise the chamber was quiet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As she lay there, unable to fight or escape, she strove not to think. Thinking would only weaken her resolve. Whatever was going to happen was going to happen, and no amount of fear or anxiety could change that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">New footsteps sounded in the hallway outside the chamber: a group of them this time, some marching in rhythm, some not. Together they created a host of raucous echoes that made it impossible to determine the number of people approaching. The procession stopped by the doorway, and she heard voices murmuring, and then two sets of clacking footsteps—the product of hard-soled riding boots, she guessed—entered the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The door closed with a hollow thud.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Down the stairs the footsteps came, steady and deliberate. She saw someone’s arm place a carved wooden chair at the very edge of her vision.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A man sat in it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He was large: not fat, but broad-shouldered. A long black cape hung draped around him. It looked heavy, as if backed with mail. Light from the coals and from the flameless lantern gilded the edges <span>of</span> his form, but his features remained too dark to make out. Still, the shadows did nothing to hide the outline of the sharp, pointed crown that rested upon his brow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her heart skipped a beat. With a struggle, it resumed its previous rapid tempo.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A second man, this one dressed in a maroon jerkin and leggings—both trimmed with gold thread—walked over to the brazier and stood with his back to her while he stirred the coals with one of the iron rods.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">One by one, the man in the chair tugged on the fingers of his gauntlets. Then he pulled off the gloves. Underneath, his hands were the color of tarnished bronze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he spoke, his voice was low, rich, and commanding. Any bard who possessed such a mellifluous instrument would have his name praised throughout the land as a master of masters. The sound of it caused her skin to prickle; his words seemed to wash over her like warm waves of water, caressing her, beguiling her, binding her. Listening to him, she realized, was as perilous as listening to Elva.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Welcome to Urû’baen, Nasuada, daughter of Ajihad,” said the man in the chair. “Welcome to this, my home, ’neath these ancient, piled rocks. Long has it been since a guest as distinguished as yourself has graced us with their presence. My energies have been occupied elsewhere, but I assure you, from now on, I shall not neglect my duties as host.” At the last, a note of menace crept into his voice, like a claw emerging from its sheath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She had never seen Galbatorix in person, only heard descriptions and studied drawings, but the effect the man’s speech had on her was so visceral, so powerful, she had no doubt that he indeed was the king.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In both his accent as well as his diction, there was something of the <span class="italic">other</span>, as if the language he spoke was not the language he had been raised with. It was a subtle difference, but impossible to ignore once she noticed. Perhaps, she decided, it was because the language <span>had</span> changed in the years since he had been born. That seemed the most reasonable explanation, as his way of speaking reminded her—No, no, it reminded her of nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He leaned forward, and she could feel his gaze boring into her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You are younger than I expected. I knew you had but recently come of age, but still, you are no more than a child. Most seem as children to me these days: prancing, preening, foolhardy children who know not what is best for them—children who need the guidance of those who are older and wiser.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Such as yourself?” she said in a scornful tone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She heard him chuckle. “Would you rather the elves ruled over us? I am the only one of our race who can hold them at bay. By their reckoning, even our oldest graybeards would be considered untested youths, unfit for the responsibilities of adulthood.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“By their reckoning, so would you.” She did not know where her courage came from, but she felt strong and defiant. Whether or not the king would punish her for it, she was determined to speak her mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah, but I contain more than my share of years. The memories of hundreds are mine. Life piled upon life: loves, hates, battles, victories, defeats, lessons learned, mistakes made—all lie within my mind, whispering their wisdom into my ears. I remember <span class="italic">eons</span>. In the whole of recorded history, there has never been one such as I, not even among the elves.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How is that possible?” she whispered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He shifted in the chair. “Do not think to pretend with me, Nasuada. I know that Glaedr gave his heart of hearts to Eragon and Saphira, and that he is there, with the Varden, even now. You understand whereof I speak.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She suppressed a thrill of fear. The fact that Galbatorix was willing to discuss such things with her—that he was willing to refer, even obliquely, to the source of his power—eliminated what little hope she still had that he ever intended to release her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he gestured at the room with his gauntlets. “Before we <span>proceed</span>, you should know something of the history of this place. When the elves first ventured to this part of the world, they discovered a crevice buried deep within the escarpment that looms over the plains hereabout. The escarpment they prized as defense against the attacks of dragons, but the crevice they prized for an entirely different reason. By happenstance, they discovered that the vapors rising out of the crack in the stone increased the chances that those who slept near it might catch a glimpse, if however confused, of future events. So, over two and a half thousand years ago, the elves built this room atop the fissure, and an oracle came to live here for many hundreds of years, even after the elves abandoned the rest of Ilirea. She sat where you now lie, and she whiled away the centuries dreaming of all that had been and all that might be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“In time, the air lost its potency and the oracle and her attendants departed. Who she was and where she went, none can say for sure. She had no name other than the title Soothsayer, and certain stories lead me to believe she was neither elf nor dwarf but something else entirely. Be that as it may, during her residency, this chamber came to be called, as you might expect, the Hall of the Soothsayer, and so it still is today—only now <span class="italic">you</span> are the soothsayer, Nasuada, daughter of Ajihad.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix spread his arms. “This is a place for truths to be told … and heard. I will tolerate no lies within these walls, not even the simplest of falsehoods. Whosoever rests upon that hard block of stone becomes the latest soothsayer, and though many have found that role difficult to accept, in the end, none have refused. You will be no different.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The legs of the chair scraped over the floor, and then she felt Galbatorix’s breath warm against her ear. “I know this will be painful for you, Nasuada, painful beyond belief. You will have to unmake yourself before your pride will allow you to submit. In all the world, nothing is harder than changing one’s own self. I understand this, for I have reshaped myself on more than one occasion. However, I will be here to hold your hand and help you through this transition. <span>You</span> need not take the journey alone. And you may console yourself with the knowledge that I will never lie to you. None of us shall. Not within this room. Doubt me if you wish, but in time you will come to believe me. I consider this a hallowed place, and I would no more desecrate the idea it represents than cut off my own hand. You may ask whatever you want, and I promise you, Nasuada, daughter of Ajihad, that we shall answer truthfully. As king of these lands, I give you my sworn word.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She worked her jaw back and forth, trying to decide how to answer. Then, from between clenched teeth, she said, “I’ll never tell you what you want to know!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A slow, deep chuckle filled the room. “You misunderstand; I didn’t have you brought here because I seek information. There’s nothing you could say that I don’t already know. The number and disposition of your troops; the state of your provisions; the locations of your supply trains; the manner in which you plan to lay siege to this citadel; Eragon and Saphira’s duties, habits, and abilities; the Dauthdaert you acquired in Belatona; even the powers of the witch-child, Elva, whom you have kept by your side until but recently—all this I know, and more. Shall I quote the figures to you? … No? Well then. My spies are more numerous and more highly placed than you imagine, and I have other means of gathering intelligence withal. You have no secrets from me, Nasuada, none whatsoever; therefore, it is pointless to insist upon holding your tongue.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His words struck her like hammerblows, but she strove not to let them dishearten her. “Why, then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why did I have you brought here? Because, my dear, you have the gift of command, and that is far deadlier than any spell. Eragon is no threat to me, nor are the elves, but you … you are dangerous in a way they are not. Without you, the Varden will be like a blinded bull; they will snort and rage, and they will charge straight ahead, heedless of what lies in their way. Then I will catch them and, with their folly, destroy them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But the destruction of the Varden is not the reason I had you <span>abducted</span>. No, you are here because you have proven yourself worthy of my attention. You are fierce, tenacious, ambitious, and intelligent—the very qualities I prize most in my servants. I wish to have you by my side, Nasuada, as my foremost adviser and as the general of my army as I move to implement the final stages of the great plan I have been laboring upon for nigh on a century. A new order is about to descend upon Alagaësia, and I would have you be a part of it. Ever since the last of the Thirteen died, I have searched for those who were fit to take their place. Until recently, my efforts have been in vain. Durza was a useful tool, but being a Shade, he had certain limitations: a lack of concern for his own preservation to name but one. Of all the candidates I have examined, Murtagh was the first I considered eligible and the first to survive the tests I set before him. You shall be the next, I am sure. And Eragon, the third.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Horror crept through her as she listened to him. What he was proposing was far worse than she had envisioned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The maroon-clad man at the brazier startled her by shoving one of the iron rods into the coals with such force, the tip banged against the copper bowl underneath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix continued speaking: “Should you live, you shall have a chance to accomplish more than you ever could with the Varden. Think of it! In my service, you could help bring peace to the whole of Alagaësia, and you would be my chief architect for accomplishing these changes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would rather let a thousand vipers bite me before I would agree to serve you.” And she spat into the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His chuckle echoed throughout the room once more: the sound of a man who feared nothing, not even death. “We shall see.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She flinched as she felt a finger touch the inside of her elbow. It slowly traced a circle, then slid down to the first of her scars on her forearm and paused atop the ridge of flesh, warm against her skin. The finger tapped three times before proceeding to the next few scars, then back again, running over them like a washboard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You have defeated an opponent in the Trial of the Long Knives,” <span>said</span> Galbatorix, “and with more cuts than any have endured in recent memory. That means both that you are exceptionally strong-willed and that you are able to suspend the functioning of your imagination—for it is an overactive imagination that turns men into cowards, not a surfeit of fear, as most believe. However, neither of these traits will be of help to you now. On the contrary, they are a hindrance. Everyone has a limit, whether physical or mental. The only question is how long it takes to reach that point. And you will reach it, I promise you. Your strength may delay the moment, but it cannot avert it. Nor will your wards avail you while you are within my power. Why, then, should you suffer needlessly? No one questions your courage; you have already demonstrated it to all the world. Give in now. There is no shame in accepting the inevitable. To continue would be to subject yourself to an array of torments for no other reason but to appease your sense of duty. Let your duty be appeased now, and give me your oath of fealty in the ancient language, and ere the hour is out, you will have a dozen servants to command, robes of silk and damask to wear, a set of chambers to live in, and a place at my table when we dine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He paused then, waiting for her answer, but she stared at the lines painted on the ceiling and refused to speak.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On her arm, the finger continued its exploration, moving from her scars to the hollow of her wrist, where it rested heavily upon a vein.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Very well. As you wish.” The pressure on her wrist vanished. “Murtagh, come, show yourself. You’re being impolite to our guest.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Ah, not him too</span>, she thought, suddenly feeling a great sadness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the brazier, the man in red slowly turned, and though he wore a silver mask over the upper half of his face, she saw it was indeed Murtagh. His eyes were nearly lost in shadows, and his mouth and jaw were fixed in a grim expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Murtagh was somewhat reluctant when he first entered my service, but he has since proven to be a most apt student. He has his father’s talents. Isn’t that so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes, sir,” said Murtagh, his voice rough.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He surprised me when he killed old King Hrothgar on the Burning Plains. I didn’t expect him to turn on his former friends with such eagerness, but then, our Murtagh is full of rage and bloodlust, he is. He would tear out the throat of a Kull with his bare hands if I gave him the chance, and I have. Nothing pleases you so much as killing, now does it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The muscles in Murtagh’s neck tensed. “No, sir.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix laughed softly. “Murtagh Kingkiller … ’Tis a fine name, a name fit for a legend, but not one you should seek to earn again, except at my direction.” Then to her: “Until now I have neglected his instruction in the subtle arts of persuasion, which is why I brought him here with me today. He has some experience as the object of such arts, but never as the practitioner, and it is high time he learns to master them. And what better way to learn than here, with you? It was Murtagh, after all, who convinced me that you were worthy of joining my newest generation of disciples.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A strange sense of betrayal crept over her. Despite what had transpired, she had thought better of Murtagh. She searched his face for an explanation, but he stood stiff as a guard on watch and kept his gaze averted; she could glean nothing from his expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the king motioned toward the brazier and, in a conversational tone of voice, said, “Take up an iron.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh’s hands curled into fists. Other than that, he did not move.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A word rang in Nasuada’s ears, like the clap of a great bell. The very warp and weft of the world seemed to vibrate at the sound, as if a giant had plucked the threads of reality and set them a-quivering. For a moment, she felt as if she were falling, and the air before her shimmered like water. Despite its power, she could not remember the letters that made up the word nor even what language it belonged to, for the word passed clean through her mind, leaving behind only the memory of its effects.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh shuddered; then he twisted, grasped one of the iron <span>rods</span>, and pulled it from the brazier with a halting motion. Sparks sprayed into the air as the iron came free of the coals, and several glittering embers fell spiraling toward the floor like pine seeds from their cones.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The end of the rod glowed a bright, pale yellow that, even as she watched, darkened to a ruddy orange. The light from the hot metal reflected off Murtagh’s polished half mask, giving him a grotesque, inhuman appearance. She saw herself reflected in the mask as well, her form distorted into a crabbed torso with spindly legs that dwindled away into thin black lines along the curve of Murtagh’s cheek.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Futile as it was, she could not help but pull against her restraints as he advanced toward her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t understand,” she said to Galbatorix with feigned calm. “Aren’t you going to use your mind against me?” Not that she wanted him to, but she would rather defend herself from an attack on her consciousness than withstand the pain of the iron.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There will be time for that later, if need be,” said Galbatorix. “For now, I am curious to discover how brave you really are, Nasuada, daughter of Ajihad. Besides, I would prefer not to seize control of your mind and force you to swear fealty to me. Instead, I want you to make this decision of your own free will and while still in possession of your faculties.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why?” she croaked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Because it pleases me. Now, for the last time, will you submit?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Never.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“So be it. Murtagh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The rod descended toward her, the tip like a giant, sparkling ruby.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They had given her nothing to bite on, so she had no choice but to scream, and the eight-sided chamber reverberated with the sounds of her agony until her voice gave out and an all-consuming darkness enveloped her in its folds.</span></p>
