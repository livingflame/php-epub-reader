<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">“NO!” SHOUTED ERAGON</span></span> as the wall of the keep tumbled down with a thunderous crash, burying Roran and five other men beneath a mound of stone twenty feet high and flooding the courtyard with a dark cloud of dust.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s shout was so loud, his voice broke, and slick, copper-tasting blood coated the back of his throat. He inhaled and doubled over, coughing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Vaetna,” he gasped, and waved his hand. With a sound like rustling silk, the thick gray dust parted, leaving the center of the courtyard clear. Concerned as he was for Roran, Eragon barely noticed the strength the spell took from him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, no, no, no,” Eragon muttered. <span class="italic">He can’t be dead. He can’t, he can’t, he can’t</span>. … As if repetition might make it true, Eragon continued to think the phrase. But with every repetition, it became less a statement of fact or hope and more a prayer to the world at large.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before him, Arya and the other warriors of the Varden stood coughing and rubbing their eyes with the palms of their hands. Many were hunched over, as if expecting a blow; others gaped at the front of the damaged keep. The rubble from the building spilled into the middle of the courtyard, obscuring the mosaic. Two and a half rooms on the second story of the keep, and one on the third—the room where the magician had expired so violently—stood exposed to the elements. The chambers and their furnishings seemed dirty and rather shabby in the full light of the sun. Within, a half-dozen soldiers armed with crossbows were scrambling back from the drop they now found themselves standing by. With much pushing <span>and</span> shoving, they hurried through the doors at the far ends of the rooms and vanished into the depths of the keep.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon tried to guess the weight of a block in the pile of rubble; it must have been many hundreds of pounds. If he, Saphira, and the elves all worked together, he was sure that they could shift the stones with magic, but the effort would leave them weak and vulnerable. Moreover, it would take an impractically long time. For a moment, Eragon thought of Glaedr—the golden dragon was more than strong enough to lift the whole pile at once—but haste was of the essence, and Glaedr’s Eldunarí would take too long to retrieve. In any case, Eragon knew that he might not even be able to convince Glaedr to talk with him, much less to help rescue Roran and the other men.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon pictured Roran as he had appeared just before the deluge of stones and dust had hidden him from view, standing underneath the eaves of the doorway to the keep, and with a start, he realized what to do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Saphira, help them!” Eragon shouted as he cast aside his shield and bounded forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind him, he heard Arya say something in the ancient language—a short phrase that might have been “Hide this!” Then she had caught up to him, running with her sword in hand, ready to fight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he reached the base of the rubble, Eragon leaped as high as he could. He alit with a single foot upon the slanting face of a block and then jumped again, bounding from point to point like a mountain goat scaling the side of a gorge. He hated to risk disturbing the blocks, but climbing the pile was the fastest way to reach his destination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With one last lunge, Eragon cleared the edge of the second story, then raced across the room. He shoved the door in front of him with such force that he broke the latch and hinges and sent the door flying into the wall of the corridor beyond, splitting the heavy oak planks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon sprinted down the corridor. His footsteps and his breathing sounded strangely muted to him, as if his ears were filled with water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He slowed as he drew near an open doorway. Through it, he saw a study with five armed men pointing at a map and arguing. None of them noticed Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He kept running.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He sped around a corner and collided with a soldier walking in the opposite direction. Eragon’s vision flashed red and yellow as his forehead struck the rim of the man’s shield. He clung to the soldier, and the two of them staggered back and forth across the corridor like a pair of drunk dancers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The soldier uttered an oath as he struggled to regain his balance. “What’s wrong with you, you thrice-blasted—” he said, and then he saw Eragon’s face, and his eyes widened. “You!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon balled his right hand and punched the man in the belly, directly underneath his rib cage. The blow lifted the man off his feet and smashed him into the ceiling. “Me,” Eragon agreed as the man dropped to the floor, lifeless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon continued down the corridor. His already rapid pulse seemed to have doubled since he entered the keep; he felt as if his heart were about to burst out of his chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Where is it</span>? he thought, frantic as he glanced through yet another doorway and saw nothing but an empty room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last, at the end of a dingy side passage, he caught sight of a winding staircase. He took the stairs five at a time, heedless of his own safety as he descended toward the first story, pausing only to push a startled archer out of his way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The stairs ended, and he emerged into a high-vaulted chamber reminiscent of the cathedral in Dras-Leona. He spun around, gathering quick impressions: shields and arms and red pennants hung on the walls; narrow windows close under the ceiling; torches mounted in wrought-iron brackets; empty fireplaces; long, dark trestle tables stacked along both sides of the hall; and a dais at the head of the <span>room</span>, where a robed and bearded man stood before a high-backed chair. Eragon was in the main hall of the castle. To his right, between him and the doors that led to the entrance of the keep, was a contingent of fifty or more soldiers. The gold thread in their tunics glittered as they stirred with surprise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Kill him!” the robed man ordered, sounding more frightened than lordly. “Whosoever kills him shall have a third of my treasure! So I promise!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A terrible frustration welled up inside Eragon at being delayed once again. He tore his sword from its scabbard, lifted it over his head, and shouted:</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Brisingr!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a rush of air, a cocoon of wraithlike blue flames sprang into existence around the blade, running up toward the tip. The heat from the fire warmed Eragon’s hand, arm, and the side of his face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon lowered his gaze to the soldiers. “Move,” he growled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The soldiers hesitated a moment more, then turned and fled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon charged forward, ignoring the panicked laggards within reach of his burning sword. One man tripped and fell before him; Eragon jumped completely over the soldier, not even touching the tassel on his helm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The wind from Eragon’s passage tore at the flames on the blade, stretching them out behind the sword like the mane of a galloping horse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Hunching his shoulders, Eragon bulled past the double doors that guarded the entrance to the main hall. He dashed through a long, wide chamber edged with rooms full of soldiers—as well as gears, pulleys, and other mechanisms used for raising and lowering the gates of the keep—and then ran full tilt into the portcullis that blocked the way to where Roran had been standing when the keep wall collapsed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The iron grating bent as Eragon slammed into it, but not enough to break the metal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He staggered back a step.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He again channeled energy stored within the diamonds of his belt—the belt of Beloth the Wise—and into Brisingr, emptying the gemstones of their precious store as he stoked the sword’s fire to an almost unbearable intensity. A wordless shout escaped him as he drew back his arm and struck at the portcullis. Orange and yellow sparks sprayed him, pitting his gloves and tunic and stinging his exposed flesh. A drop of molten iron fell sizzling onto the tip of his boot. With a twitch of his ankle, he shook it off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Three cuts he made, and a man-sized section of the portcullis fell inward. The severed ends of the grating glowed white-hot, lighting the area with their soft radiance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon allowed the flames rising from Brisingr to die out as he proceeded through the opening he had created.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">First to the left, then to the right, and then to the left again he ran as the passage alternated directions, the convoluted path designed to slow the advance of troops if they managed to gain access to the keep.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he rounded the last corner, Eragon saw his destination: the debris-choked vestibule. Even with his elflike vision, he could make out only the largest shapes in the darkness, for the falling stones had extinguished the torches on the walls. He heard an odd huffing and scuffling, as if some sort of clumsy beast were rooting through the rubble.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Naina,” said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A directionless blue light illuminated the space. And there before him, covered in dirt, blood, ash, and sweat, with his teeth bared in a fearsome snarl, appeared Roran, grappling with a soldier over the corpses of two others.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The soldier winced at the sudden brightness, and Roran took advantage of the man’s distraction to twist and push him to his knees, whereupon he grabbed the soldier’s dagger from his belt and drove it up under the corner of his jaw.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The soldier kicked twice and then was still.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Panting for breath, Roran rose from the body, blood dripping from his fingers. He looked over at Eragon with a curiously glazed expression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“About time you—” he said, and then his eyes rolled back into his head as he fainted.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_15"></div></body>
