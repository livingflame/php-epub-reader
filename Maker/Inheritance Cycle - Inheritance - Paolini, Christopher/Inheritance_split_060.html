<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON LIFTED HIS</span></span> sword and shield, eager to proceed, but also somewhat afraid.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As before, he and Saphira stood at the base of the Rock of Kuthian while Glaedr’s heart of hearts sat in the small chest hidden within the saddlebags upon Saphira’s back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was still early morning, and the sun shone brightly through large tears in the canopy of clouds. Eragon and Saphira had wanted to go directly to the Rock of Kuthian once Eragon had returned to the nesting house, but Glaedr had insisted that Eragon eat first, and that they then wait for the food to settle in his stomach.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">But now they were finally at the jagged spire of stone, and Eragon was tired of waiting, as was Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Ever since they had shared their true names, the bond between them seemed to have grown stronger, perhaps because they had both heard how much they cared for each other. It was something they had always known, but nevertheless, to have it stated in such irrefutable terms had increased the sense of closeness they shared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Somewhere to the north, a raven called.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I’ll go first</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">If it’s a trap, I might be able to spring it before it catches either of you</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon started to pull his mind away from Glaedr, as did Saphira, to allow the dragon to utter his true name without being overheard. But Glaedr said, <span class="italic">No, you have told me your names. It is only right you should know mine</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked at Saphira, and then they both said, <span class="italic">Thank you, Ebrithil</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Glaedr spoke his name, and it boomed forth in Eragon’s <span>mind</span> like a fanfare of trumpets, regal and yet discordant, colored throughout by Glaedr’s grief and anger at Oromis’s death. His name was longer than either Eragon’s or Saphira’s; it went on for several sentences—a record of a life that had stretched over centuries and which had contained joys and sorrows and accomplishments too numerous to count. His wisdom was evident in his name, but also contradictions: complexities that made it difficult to fully grasp his identity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira felt the same sense of awe upon hearing Glaedr’s name as did Eragon; the sound of it made them both realize how young they still were and how far they had to go before they could hope to match Glaedr’s knowledge and experience.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I wonder what Arya’s true name is</span>. Eragon thought to himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They watched the Rock of Kuthian intently, but saw no change.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira went next. Arching her neck and pawing at the ground like a high-spirited charger, she proudly stated her true name. Even in the daylight, her scales again shimmered and sparkled at the proclamation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Hearing her and Glaedr say their true names made Eragon less self-conscious about his own. None of them were perfect, and yet they did not condemn each other for their shortcomings, but rather acknowledged and forgave them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again, nothing happened after Saphira uttered her name.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Lastly, Eragon stepped forward. A cold sweat coated his brow. Knowing that it might be his final act as a free man, he spoke his name with his mind, as had Glaedr and Saphira. They had agreed beforehand that it would be safer for him to avoid saying his name out loud, so as to reduce the chance that anyone might overhear it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Eragon formed the last word with his thoughts, a thin, dark line appeared at the base of the spire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It ran upward fifty feet and then split in two and arched down to either side, tracing the outline of two broad doors. Upon the doors appeared row after row of glyphs limned in gold: wards against both physical and magical detection.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once the outline was complete, the doors swung outward upon hidden hinges, scraping aside the dirt and plants that had accumulated before the spire since the doors had last opened, whenever that had been. Through the doorway was a huge vaulted tunnel that descended at a steep angle into the bowels of the earth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The doors ground to a halt, and the clearing fell silent again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stared at the dark tunnel, feeling a sense of increasing apprehension. They had found what they were looking for, but he still was not sure if it was a trap or not.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Solembum did not lie</span>, said Saphira. Her tongue darted out as she tasted the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, but what’s waiting for us inside</span>? asked Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">This place should not exist</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">We and the Riders hid many secrets on Vroengard, but the island is too small for a tunnel as large as this to have been built without others knowing. And yet I have never heard of it before</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon frowned and glanced about. They were still alone; no one was trying to sneak up on them. <span class="italic">Could it have been built before the Riders made Vroengard their home</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Glaedr thought for a moment. <span class="italic">I do not know. … Perhaps. It is the only explanation that makes sense, but if so, then it is ancient indeed</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The three of them searched the passageway with their minds, but they felt no living thing within it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Right then</span>, said Eragon. The sour taste of dread filled his mouth, and his palms were slick within his gloves. Whatever they were about to find at the other end of the tunnel, he wanted to know once and for all. Saphira was also nervous, but less than he.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Let us dig out the rat hiding in this nest</span>, she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Together then, they walked through the doorway and into the tunnel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the last inch of Saphira’s tail slid over the threshold, the doors swung shut behind them and closed with a loud crack of stone meeting stone, plunging them into darkness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah, no, no, no!” growled Eragon, rushing back to the doors. “Naina hvitr,” he said, and a directionless white light illuminated the entrance to the tunnel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The inner surfaces of the doors were perfectly smooth, and no matter how he pushed and pounded on them, they refused to budge. “Blast it. We should have used a log or a boulder to wedge them open,” he lamented, berating himself for not thinking of it beforehand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If we have to, we can always break them down</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">That I very much doubt</span>, said Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon regripped Brisingr. <span class="italic">Then I guess we have no choice but to go forward</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">When have we ever had any choice but to go forward</span>? asked Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon altered his spell so that the werelight emanated from a single point near the ceiling—otherwise the lack of shadows made it difficult for him and Saphira to judge depth—and then, together, they started down the slanting tunnel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The floor of the passageway was somewhat knobbly, which made it easy for them to maintain their footing in the absence of steps. Where the floor and the walls met, they flowed together as if the stone had been melted, which told Eragon that it was most likely elves who had excavated the tunnel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Down they went, deeper and deeper into the earth, until Eragon guessed they had passed under the foothills behind the Rock of Kuthian and burrowed into the roots of the mountain beyond. The tunnel neither turned nor branched, and the walls remained utterly bare.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last Eragon felt a hint of warm air rising toward them from farther down the tunnel, and he noticed a faint orange glow in the distance. “Letta,” he murmured, and extinguished the werelight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The air continued to warm as they descended, and the glow before them waxed in brightness. Soon they were able to see an end to the tunnel: a huge black arch that was covered entirely with <span>sculpted</span> glyphs, which made the arch look as if it were wrapped in thorns. The smell of brimstone tainted the air, and Eragon felt his eyes begin to water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They stopped before the archway; through it, all they could see was a flat gray floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon glanced back the way they had come, then returned his gaze to the arch. The jagged structure made him nervous, and Saphira as well. He tried to read the glyphs, but they were too jumbled and too densely packed to make sense of, nor could he detect any energy stored within the black structure. Yet he had difficulty believing that it was not enchanted. Whoever built the tunnel had succeeded in hiding the latch spell for the doors to the outside, which meant they could have done the same with any spells they had placed upon the arch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He exchanged a quick look with Saphira, and he wet his lips as he remembered what Glaedr had said: <span class="italic">There are no more safe paths</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira snorted, releasing a small jet of flame from the pit of each nostril, and then, as one, she and Eragon walked through the archway.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_120"></div></body>
