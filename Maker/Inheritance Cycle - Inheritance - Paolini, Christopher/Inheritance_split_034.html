<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON ROLLED HIS</span></span> shoulders, trying to get his mail hauberk to rest comfortably under the tunic he wore to hide the armor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Darkness lay all around them, heavy and oppressive. A thick layer of clouds obscured the moon and the stars. Without the red werelight Angela held in the palm of her hand, even Eragon and the elves would have been unable to see.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The air was humid, and once or twice, Eragon felt a few cold drops of rain strike his cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elva had laughed and refused when he had asked for her help. He had argued with her long and hard, but to no avail. Saphira had even intervened, flying down to the tent where the witch-child was staying and placing her massive head just feet away from the girl, forcing her to look into one of Saphira’s brilliant, unblinking eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elva had not had the temerity to laugh then, but she remained obdurate in her refusal. Her stubbornness frustrated Eragon. Still, he could not help but admire her strength of character; to say no to both a Rider and a dragon was no small thing. Then again, she had endured an incredible amount of pain in her short life, and the experience had hardened her to a degree rarely seen even in the most jaded of warriors.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Beside him, Arya fastened a long cloak around her neck. Eragon wore one as well, as did Angela and the black-haired elf Wyrden, whom Blödhgarm had chosen to accompany them. The cloaks were needed to protect them against the night chill, as well as to conceal their weapons from anyone they might encounter in the city, if they got that far.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada, Jörmundur, and Saphira had accompanied them to the <span>edge</span> of the camp, where they now stood. Among the tents, the men of the Varden, dwarves, and Urgals were busy preparing to march forth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Don’t forget,” said Nasuada, her breath steaming in front of her, “if you can’t reach the gates by dawn, find somewhere to wait until tomorrow morning, and we’ll try again then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We may not have the luxury of waiting,” said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada rubbed her arms and nodded. She appeared unusually worried. “I know. Either way, we’ll be ready to attack as soon as you contact us, no matter the time of day. Your safety is more important than capturing Dras-Leona. Remember that.” Her gaze drifted toward Eragon as she spoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We should be off,” said Wyrden. “The night grows old.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon pressed his forehead against Saphira for a moment. <span class="italic">Good hunting</span>, she said softly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And you as well</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They reluctantly parted, and Eragon joined Arya and Wyrden as they followed Angela away from the camp, heading toward the eastern edge of the city. Nasuada and Jörmundur murmured well-wishes and farewells as they strode past, and then all was quiet, save the sounds of their breathing and of their boots on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Angela dimmed the light in her palm until it was barely bright enough for Eragon to see his feet. He had to strain his eyes to spot rocks and branches that lay in the way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They walked in silence for nearly an hour, at which point the herbalist stopped and whispered, “We’re here, as best I can tell. I’m fairly good at reckoning distances, but we might be off by more than a thousand feet. It’s hard to be certain of anything in this gloom.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Off to their left, a half-dozen pinpricks of light floated above the horizon, the only evidence that they were anywhere near Dras-Leona. The lights seemed close enough to pluck from the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and the two women gathered around Wyrden as the elf knelt and pulled the glove off his right hand. Placing his palm against the bare earth, Wyrden began to croon the spell he had learned from <span>the</span> dwarven magician whom—ere they left on their mission—Orik had sent to instruct them in the ways of detecting underground chambers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">While the elf sang, Eragon stared into the surrounding blackness, listening and watching for enemies. The fall of raindrops on his face increased. He hoped the weather would improve before battle was joined, if battle was to be joined.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">An owl hooted somewhere, and he reached for Brisingr, only to stop himself and clench his fist. <span class="italic">Barzûl</span>, he said to himself, using Orik’s favorite curse. He was more nervous than he ought to be. The knowledge that he might be about to fight Murtagh and Thorn again—singly or together—had put him on edge.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I’ll be sure to lose if I keep on like this</span>, he thought. So he slowed his breathing and initiated the first of the mental exercises Glaedr had taught him for establishing control over his emotions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The old dragon had not been enthusiastic about the mission when Eragon told him about it, but neither had he opposed it. After discussing various contingencies, Glaedr had said: <span class="italic">Beware of the shadows, Eragon. Strange things lurk in dark places</span>, which, Eragon thought, was hardly an encouraging statement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He wiped the accumulated moisture off his face, keeping his other hand close to the hilt of his sword. The leather of his glove was warm and smooth against his skin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Lowering his hand, he hooked his thumb under his sword belt, the belt of Beloth the Wise, conscious of the weight of the twelve flawless diamonds concealed within. That morning, he had gone to the livestock pens, and as the cooks killed the birds and sheep for the army’s breakfast, he had transferred the animals’ dying energy into the gems. He hated doing so; when he reached out with his mind to an animal—if it still had its head attached—the animal’s fear and pain became his own, and as it slipped into the void, he felt as if he himself were dying. It was a horrible, panic-inducing experience. Whenever he could, he had whispered words in the ancient language to the animals in an attempt to comfort them. Sometimes <span>it</span> worked, sometimes not. Though the creatures would have died in any case, and though he needed the energy, he hated the practice, for it made him feel as if <span class="italic">he</span> were responsible for their deaths. It made him feel unclean.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Now he fancied that the belt was slightly heavier than before, laden as it was with the energy from so many animals. Even if the diamonds within had been worthless, Eragon would have regarded the belt as valuable beyond gold, on account of the dozens of lives that had gone into filling it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Wyrden ceased singing, Arya asked, “Have you found it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This way,” said Wyrden, standing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Relief and trepidation swept through Eragon. <span class="italic">Jeod was right!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Wyrden led them over a road and a series of small hills, then down into a shallow wash hidden within the folds of the land. “The mouth of the tunnel should be somewhere here,” said the elf, and gestured at the western bank of the depression.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The herbalist increased the brightness of her werelight enough for them to search by; then Eragon, Arya, and Wyrden began to comb through the brush along the side of the bank, poking at the ground with sticks. Twice Eragon barked his shins against the stumps of fallen birch trees, causing him to suck in his breath with pain. He wished he was wearing bracers, but he had left them behind, along with his shield, because they would have attracted too much attention in the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For twenty minutes, they searched, ranging up and down the bank as they worked their way out from their starting point. At last Eragon heard a ring of metal, and then Arya softly called, “Here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and the others hurried toward her, where she stood by a small, overgrown hollow in the side of the bank. Arya drew aside the brush to reveal a stone-lined tunnel five feet tall and three feet wide. A rusting iron grate covered the gaping hole.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Look,” said Arya, and she pointed at the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked, and he saw a path leading out of the tunnel. Even by the weird red illumination of the herbalist’s werelight, Eragon <span>could</span> tell that the trail had been worn into place by the passage of tramping feet. One or more people must have been using the tunnel to surreptitiously enter and exit Dras-Leona.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We should proceed with caution,” whispered Wyrden.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Angela made a faint noise in her throat. “How else were you planning to proceed? With blaring trumpets and shouting heralds? Really.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elf refrained from answering, but he appeared distinctly uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya and Wyrden pulled off the grating and cautiously moved into the tunnel. Both conjured werelights of their own. The flameless orbs floated over their heads like small red suns, though they emitted no more light than a handful of coals.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hung back and said to Angela, “Why do the elves treat you so respectfully? They seem almost afraid of you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Am I not deserving of respect?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He hesitated. “One of these days, you know, you’re going to have to tell me about yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What makes you think that?” And she pushed past him to enter the tunnel, her cloak flapping like the wings of a Lethrblaka.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Shaking his head, Eragon followed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The short herbalist did not have to bend much in order to avoid bumping into the ceiling, but Eragon had to hunch like an old man with rheumatism, as did the two elves. For the most part, the tunnel was empty. A fine layer of caked dirt covered the floor. A few sticks and rocks, and even a discarded snakeskin, were scattered near the mouth of the tunnel. The passageway smelled like damp straw and moth wings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon and the others walked as quietly as they could, but the tunnel magnified sounds. Every bump and scrape echoed, filling the air with a multitude of overlapping whispers that seemed to murmur and sigh with a life of their own. The whispers made Eragon feel as if they were surrounded by a host of disembodied spirits who were commenting on their every move.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">So much for sneaking up on anyone</span>, he thought as he scuffed his boot against a rock, which bounced against the side of the tunnel with a loud <span class="italic">clack</span> that multiplied a hundredfold as it spread through the tunnel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sorry,” he mouthed as everyone looked at him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A wry smile touched his lips. <span class="italic">At least we know what causes the strange sounds underneath Dras-Leona</span>. He would have to tell Jeod on their return.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When they had gone a fair ways down the tunnel, Eragon paused and looked back at the entrance, which was already lost in darkness. The gloom seemed almost palpable, like a heavy cloth draped over the world. Combined with the close-set walls and low ceiling, it left him feeling cramped and constricted. Normally, he did not mind being in enclosed places, but the tunnel reminded him of the warren of rough-hewn passageways within Helgrind where he and Roran had fought the Ra’zac—hardly a pleasant memory.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He took a deep breath, then released it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Just as he was about to continue forward, he caught a glimpse of two large eyes gleaming in the shadows, like a pair of copper-colored moonstones. He grabbed Brisingr and had already drawn the sword several inches from its scabbard when Solembum appeared out of the murk, padding along on silent paws.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The werecat stopped at the edge of the light. He twitched his black-tipped ears, and his jaws parted in what seemed to be an expression of amusement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon relaxed and acknowledged the werecat’s presence with a dip of his head. <span class="italic">I should have guessed</span>. Wherever Angela went, Solembum invariably followed. Again Eragon wondered about the herbalist’s past: <span class="italic">How did she ever win his loyalty</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the rest of the party grew distant, the shadows crept over Solembum once more, hiding him from Eragon’s sight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Comforted by the knowledge that the werecat was watching his back, Eragon hurried to catch up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before the group left the camp, Nasuada had briefed them on <span>the</span> exact number of soldiers in the city, as well as where they were stationed and their duties and habits. She had also given them details about Murtagh’s sleeping quarters, what he ate, and even his mood the previous evening. Her information had been remarkably precise. When questioned, she had smiled and explained that, since the Varden had arrived, the werecats had been spying for her within Dras-Leona. Once Eragon and his companions emerged within the city, the werecats would escort them to the southern gates but would not reveal their own presence to the Empire if at all possible, else they would no longer be able to supply Nasuada with intelligence as effectively. After all, who would suspect that the unusually large cat lounging nearby was actually an enemy spy?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It occurred to Eragon then, as he reviewed Nasuada’s briefing, that one of Murtagh’s greatest weaknesses was that he still had to sleep. <span class="italic">If we don’t capture or kill him today, the next time we meet, it might help us to find a way to wake him in the middle of the night—and for more nights than one, if we could manage it. Three or four days without proper sleep and he’d be in no fit shape to fight</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On and on they went through the tunnel, which ran straight as an arrow, never bending, never turning. Eragon thought he detected a slight upward slant to the floor—which would make sense, as it was designed to channel waste out of the city—but he was not entirely sure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a while, the dirt beneath their feet began to soften and stick to their boots, like wet clay. Water dripped from the ceiling, sometimes landing on the nape of Eragon’s neck and rolling down his spine, like the touch of a cold finger. He slipped once on a patch of mud and, when he put out a hand for balance, found the wall covered in slime.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">An indeterminate amount of time passed. They might have spent an hour in the tunnel. They might have spent ten. Or maybe it was only a few minutes. Whatever the case, Eragon’s neck and shoulders hurt from standing half bent over, and he grew tired of staring at what seemed to be the same twenty feet of rose-hued stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last he noticed the echoes were waning and ever more of a delay was appearing between each repetition of the sounds. Soon afterward, the tunnel disgorged them into a large rectangular chamber with a ridged, half-dome ceiling over fifteen feet high at its apex. The chamber was empty, except for a rotting barrel in one corner. Across from them, three identical archways opened to three identical rooms, small and dark. Where those led, Eragon could not see.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The group stopped, and Eragon slowly straightened his back, wincing as his sore muscles stretched.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This would not have been part of Erst Graybeard’s plans,” said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Which path should we pick?” asked Wyrden.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Isn’t it obvious?” asked the herbalist. “The left one. It’s always the left one.” And she strode toward that selfsame arch even as she spoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon could not help himself. “Left according to which direction? If you were starting from the other side, left—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Left would be right and right would be left, yes, yes,” said the herbalist. Her eyes narrowed. “Sometimes you’re too clever for your own good, Shadeslayer. … Very well, we’ll try it your way. But don’t say I didn’t warn you if we end up wandering around here for days on end.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon would actually have preferred to take the center archway, as it seemed the most likely to lead them up to the streets, but he did not want to get into an argument with the herbalist. <span class="italic">Either way, we’ll find stairs soon enough</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">There can’t be that many chambers under Dras-Leona</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Holding her werelight aloft, Angela took the lead. Wyrden and Arya followed while Eragon brought up the rear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The room through the rightmost archway was larger than it had first appeared, for it extended to the side for twenty feet, then turned and continued for another few yards, whereupon it ended at a corridor studded with empty sconces. Down the corridor was another <span>small</span> room lined with three arches, each of which led to rooms with even more archways, and so on.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Who built these and why</span>? Eragon wondered, bewildered. All the rooms they saw were deserted and empty of furnishings. The only things they found within were a two-legged stool that fell apart when he nudged it with the tip of his boot and a pile of broken pottery lying in a corner beneath a veil of spiderwebs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Angela never hesitated or seemed confused about which direction to go, for without fail, she chose the path to the right. Eragon would have objected, except that he could think of no better alternative to her method.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The herbalist stopped when they arrived at a circular room with seven equally spaced archways placed along the walls. Seven corridors, including the one they had just traversed, stretched out from the archways.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mark where we came from, or we’ll get completely turned around,” said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon went to the corridor and, with the tip of Brisingr’s crossguard, scratched a line on the stone wall. As he did, he peered into the darkness, searching for a glimpse of Solembum, but he saw not so much as a whisker. Eragon hoped the werecat had not gotten lost somewhere in the maze of rooms. He almost reached out with his mind to find him, but resisted the urge; if anyone else felt him groping around, it might alert the Empire to their location.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah!” exclaimed Angela, and the shadows around Eragon shifted as the herbalist stood on tiptoe and raised her werelight as high as she could.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hurried to the center of the room, where she stood with Arya and Wyrden. “What is it?” he whispered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The ceiling, Eragon,” murmured Arya. “Look at the ceiling.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He did as he was told, but saw only blocks of ancient, mold-covered stones crazed with so many cracks, it seemed amazing the ceiling had not collapsed long ago.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then his vision shifted and he gasped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The lines were not cracks but rather deeply carved runes—rows of them. They were neat and small, with sharp angles and straight stems. Mold and the passage of centuries had obscured parts of the text, but most of it remained legible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon struggled with the runes for a short while, but he recognized only a few of the words, and those were spelled differently than he was used to. “What does it say?” he asked. “Is it Dwarvish?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Wyrden. “It is the language of your people, but as it was spoken and written long ago, and of a very particular dialect: that of the zealot Tosk.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The name struck a chord in Eragon. “When Roran and I rescued Katrina, we heard the priests of Helgrind mention a book of Tosk.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Wyrden nodded. “It serves as the foundation of their faith. Tosk was not the first to offer up prayers to Helgrind, but he was the first to codify his beliefs and practices, and many others have imitated him since. Those who worship Helgrind regard him as a prophet of the divine. And <span class="italic">this</span>”—the elf cast his arms out wide—“is a history of Tosk, from his birth to his death: a true history, such as his disciples have never shared with those outside their sect.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We could learn much from this,” said Angela, never taking her eyes off the ceiling. “If only we had the time …” Eragon was surprised to see her so enthralled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya glanced at the seven corridors. “A moment, then, but read quickly.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">While Angela and Wyrden perused the runes with avid intensity, Arya walked over to one of the archways and, in an undertone, began to chant a spell for finding and locating. When she finished, she waited a moment with her head cocked, then moved on to the next archway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stared at the runes a bit longer. Then he returned to the mouth of the corridor that had brought them to the room and <span>leaned</span> against a wall while he waited. The cold of the stones seeped into his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya stopped in front of the fourth archway. The now-familiar cadence of her recitation rose and fell like a soft sigh of wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again, nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A faint tickling on the back of his right hand caused Eragon to look down. A huge, wingless cricket clung to his glove. The insect was hideous: black and bulbous, with barbed legs and a massive, skull-like head. Its carapace gleamed like oil.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shuddered, his skin crawling, and shook his arm, flinging the cricket into the darkness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It landed with an audible <span class="italic">thump</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The fifth corridor proved no more fruitful for Arya than the preceding four. She bypassed the opening where Eragon stood and stationed herself in front of the seventh archway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before she could cast her spell, a guttural yowl echoed down the corridors, seemingly from all directions at once; then there was a hiss and a spat and a screech that made every hair on Eragon’s body stand on end.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Angela whirled around. “Solembum!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As one, the four of them drew their blades.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon backed into the center of the room, his gaze darting from one archway to the next. His gedwëy ignasia itched and tingled like a fleabite—a useless warning, for it did not tell him where or what the danger was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This way,” said Arya, moving toward the seventh archway.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The herbalist refused to budge. “No!” she whispered vehemently. “We have to help him.” Eragon noticed that she held a short sword with a strange colorless blade that flashed gemlike in the light.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya scowled. “If Murtagh learns we’re here, we’ll—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It happened so quickly and silently, Eragon would never have noticed had he not been looking in the right direction: a half-dozen doors hidden within the walls of three different corridors swung <span>open</span>, and thirty or so black-garbed men ran out toward them, swords in hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Letta!” shouted Wyrden, and the men in one group collided with each other as if those in front had run headlong into a wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the rest of the attackers fell upon them, and there was no time for magic. Eragon easily parried a stab, and with a looping backhanded stroke, sliced off the attacker’s head. Like all the others, the man wore a kerchief tied over his face, so only his eyes were exposed, and the kerchief fluttered as the head fell spinning toward the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was relieved when he felt Brisingr sink into flesh and blood. For a moment, he had feared that their opponents were protected by spells or armor—or, worse, that they were something other than human.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He skewered another man through the ribs and had just turned to deal with two more of his attackers when a sword that should not have been there arced through the air toward his throat. His wards saved him from certain death, yet with the blade an inch away from his neck, Eragon could not help but stumble back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To his astonishment, the man he had stabbed was still standing, blood streaming down his side, seemingly oblivious to the hole Eragon had poked through him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Dread settled over Eragon. “They can’t feel pain,” he shouted, even as he frantically blocked swords from three different directions. If anyone heard him, they failed to respond.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He wasted no more time talking, but concentrated on fighting the men in front of him, trusting his companions to protect his back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon lunged and parried and dodged, whipping Brisingr through the air as if it weighed no more than a switch. Ordinarily, he could have killed any of the men in an instant, but the fact that they were impervious to pain meant that he had to either behead them, stab them through the heart, or cut them and hold them off <span>until</span> loss of blood rendered them unconscious. Otherwise, the attackers kept trying to kill him, regardless of their injuries. The number of men made it difficult to evade all of their blows and strike back in return. He could have stopped defending himself and just let his wards protect him, but that would tire him just as quickly as swinging Brisingr. And since he could not predict exactly when his wards would fail—as they must at a certain point, else they would kill him—and he knew he might need them later on, he fought just as carefully and cautiously as if he were facing men whose swords could kill or maim with a single stroke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">More black-garbed warriors streamed out of the hidden doorways within the corridors. They crowded around Eragon, pushing him back through sheer weight of numbers. Hands clung to his legs and arms, threatening to immobilize him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Kverst,” he growled under his breath, uttering one of the twelve death words Oromis had taught him. As he had suspected, his spell had no effect: the men were warded against direct magical attacks. He quickly readied a spell Murtagh had once used on him: “Thrysta vindr!” It was a roundabout way of striking at the men, as he was not actually hitting them but rather pushing the air against them. In any case, it worked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A howl of wind filled the chamber, clawing at Eragon’s hair and cloak and sending the men closest to him flying back into their compatriots, clearing a space of ten feet in front of him. His strength decreased commensurately, but not enough to incapacitate him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He turned to see how the others were doing. He had not been the first to find a way to circumvent the men’s wards; bolts of lightning extended from Wyrden’s right arm and wrapped themselves around any warrior unfortunate enough to pass in front of him. The glowing cables of energy appeared almost liquid as they writhed around their victims.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Still more men were forcing their way into the room, however.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This way!” cried Arya, and sprang toward the seventh corridor—the one she had failed to examine before the ambush.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Wyrden followed, as did Eragon. Angela brought up the rear, limping and clutching at a bloody cut on her shoulder. Behind them, the black-garbed men hesitated, milling in the chamber for a moment. Then, with a mighty roar, they gave chase.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he sprinted down the corridor, Eragon strove to compose a variation of his earlier spell that would allow him to kill the men instead of just knocking them away. He quickly devised one and held it in readiness to use as soon as he could see a fair number of the attackers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Who are they</span>? he wondered. <span class="italic">How many of them are there</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Up ahead, he glimpsed an opening through which shone a faint purplish light. He just had time to feel apprehensive about its source before the herbalist uttered a loud cry, and there was a dull orange flash and a teeth-jarring <span class="italic">thud</span>, and the smell of sulfur filled the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon whirled around to see five men dragging the herbalist through a doorway that had opened in the side of the corridor. “No!” yelled Eragon, but before he could stop it, the door swung shut as silently as it had opened, and the wall appeared perfectly solid once more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Brisingr!” he shouted, and his sword erupted in flame. He placed the tip against the wall and attempted to push it through the stone, intending to cut open the door. The stone was thick, though, and slow to melt, and he soon realized it would take far more energy than he was willing to sacrifice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Arya appeared beside him, and she placed a hand where the door was and murmured, “Ládrin.” <span class="italic">Open</span>. The door remained stubbornly closed, but Eragon was embarrassed he had not thought to try that first.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Their pursuers were so close by now that he and Arya had no choice but to turn and face them. Eragon wanted to cast the spell he had invented, but the corridor was only wide enough for two men to approach at a time; he would not be able to kill the rest, as they were hidden from sight. Better to keep the spell a secret, he decided, and save it for when he could wipe out most of the warriors at once.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and Arya beheaded the two lead men, then attacked the next pair of warriors as they stepped over the bodies. In quick succession, they killed six more men, but there seemed to be no end of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Through here!” shouted Wyrden.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Stenr slauta!” exclaimed Arya, and all along the corridor—up to a few yards from where she stood—the stones in the walls exploded into the passageway. The hail of sharp fragments caused the black-clad men to cower and falter, and more than one fell to the floor, crippled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Together Eragon and Arya turned to follow Wyrden, who was running toward the opening at the end of the corridor. The elf was only thirty feet away from it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then ten …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then five …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And then a thicket of amethyst spikes shot out of holes in the floor and the ceiling, catching Wyrden between them. The elf seemed to float in the middle of the corridor, the spikes less than an inch away from his skin as his wards repelled the crystal thorns. Then a crackling discharge of energy ran the length of each spike and the needle-sharp tips flared painfully bright, and with an unpleasant <span class="italic">crunch</span>, they slid home.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Wyrden screamed and thrashed, and then his werelight went out and he moved no more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stared with disbelief as he stumbled to a stop before the spikes. For all his experience in battle, he had never before been present at the death of an elf. Wyrden and Blödhgarm and the rest of their cohort were so accomplished, Eragon had believed that the only way they were likely to die was while fighting either Galbatorix or Murtagh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya appeared equally stunned. She rallied quickly, however. “Eragon,” she said in an urgent voice, “cut us a path with Brisingr.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He understood. His sword, unlike hers, would be impervious to whatever evil magic the spikes contained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He drew back his arm and swung as hard as he could. A half-dozen of the spikes shattered beneath Brisingr’s adamantine edge. The amethyst emitted a bell-like tone as it broke, and when the shards struck the ground, they tinkled like ice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon kept to the right of the corridor, making sure not to hit the blood-streaked spikes that held up Wyrden’s body. Again and again he swung, hacking his way through the glittering thicket. With every blow, he sent pieces of amethyst flying through the air. One sliced his left cheek, and he winced, surprised and concerned that his wards had failed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The jagged remnants of the broken spikes forced him to move carefully. The stumps below could easily pierce his boots, while the ones above threatened to cut him about the head and neck. Still, he managed to navigate to the far side of the thicket with only a small gash on his right calf, which stung whenever he put his weight on the leg.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The black-clad warriors nearly caught up with them as he helped Arya past the last few rows of spikes. Once she was free, they rushed through the opening and into the purplish light, Eragon with every intention of then turning around and confronting their attackers head-on and killing every last one of them in retaliation for Wyrden’s death.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On the other side of the opening was a dark, heavily built chamber that reminded Eragon of the caves under Tronjheim. A huge circular pattern of inlaid stone—marble and chalcedony and polished hematite—occupied the center of the floor. Around the edge of the patterned disk stood rough, fist-sized chunks of amethyst set within silver collars. Each piece of the purple rock glowed softly—the source of the light they had seen from the corridor. Across the disk, against the far wall, was a large black altar draped with a gold and crimson cloth. Pillars and candelabra flanked the altar, with a closed door on each side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">All this Eragon saw as he barreled into the room, in the brief <span>instant</span> before he realized that his momentum was going to carry him through the ring of amethysts and onto the disk. He tried to stop himself, tried to turn aside, but he was moving too fast.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Desperate, he did the one thing he could: he jumped toward the altar, hoping he could clear the disk in a single bound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he sailed over the nearest of the amethyst stones, his last feeling was regret, and his last thought was of Saphira.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_67"></div></body>
