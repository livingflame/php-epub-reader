<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">THE SUN WAS</span></span> climbing into the sky, as was Saphira, when from his place on her back, Eragon spotted Helgrind on the edge of the northern horizon. He felt a surge of loathing as he beheld the distant spike of rock, which rose from the surrounding landscape like a single jagged tooth. So many of his most unpleasant memories were associated with Helgrind, he wished he could destroy it and see its bare gray spires fall crashing to the ground. Saphira was more indifferent to the dark tower of stone, but he could tell that she too disliked being near it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">By the time evening arrived, Helgrind lay behind them, while Dras-Leona lay before them, next to Leona Lake, where dozens of ships and boats bobbed at anchor. The low, broad city was as densely built and inhospitable as Eragon remembered, with its narrow, crooked streets, the filthy hovels packed close together against the yellow mud wall that ringed the center of the city, and behind the wall, the towering shape of Dras-Leona’s immense cathedral, black and barbed, where the priests of Helgrind conducted their gruesome rituals.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A stream of refugees trailed along the road to the north—people fleeing the soon-to-be-besieged city for Teirm or Urû’baen, where they might find at least temporary safety from the Varden’s inexorable advance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Dras-Leona seemed as foul and evil to Eragon as when he had first visited it, and it aroused in him a lust for destruction such as he had not felt at either Feinster or Belatona. Here he wanted to lay waste with fire and sword; to lash out with all of the terrible, unnatural energies that were at his disposal; and to indulge in every savage urge <span>and</span> leave behind him nothing but a pit of smoking, blood-soaked ashes. For the poor and the crippled and the enslaved who lived within the confines of Dras-Leona, he had some sympathy. But he was wholly convinced of the city’s corruption and believed that the best thing would be to raze it and rebuild it without the taint of perversity the religion of Helgrind had infected it with.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he fantasized about tearing down the cathedral with Saphira’s help, it occurred to him to wonder if the religion of the priests who practiced self-mutilation had a name. His study of the ancient language had taught him to appreciate the importance of names—names were power, names were <span class="italic">understanding</span>—and until he knew the name of the religion, he would not be able to fully apprehend its true nature.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the waning light, the Varden settled on a series of cultivated fields just southeast of Dras-Leona, where the land rose up to a slight plateau, which would provide them with a modicum of protection should the enemy charge their position. The men were weary from marching, but Nasuada put them to work fortifying the camp, as well as assembling the mighty engines of war they had brought with them all the long way from Surda.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon threw himself into the work with a will. First, he joined a team of men who were flattening the fields of wheat and barley, using planks with long loops of rope attached. It would have been faster to scythe the grain, either with steel or magic, but the stubble that remained would be dangerous and uncomfortable to walk over, much less to sleep upon. As it was, the compacted stalks formed a soft, springy surface as fine as any mattress, and one far preferable to the bare ground they were accustomed to.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon labored alongside the other men for almost an hour, at which point they had cleared enough space for the tents of the Varden.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he helped in the construction of a siege tower. His greater-than-normal strength allowed him to shift beams that otherwise would have taken several warriors to move; thus, he was able to <span>speed</span> the process. A few of the dwarves who were still with the Varden oversaw the raising of the tower, for the engines were of their design.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira helped as well. With her teeth and claws, she gouged deep trenches in the ground and piled the removed earth into embankments around the camp, accomplishing more in a few minutes than a hundred men could have in a whole day. And, with the fire from her maw and mighty sweeps of her tail, she leveled trees, fences, walls, houses, and everything else around the Varden that might give their foes cover. In all, she presented a picture of fearsome devastation sufficient to inspire trepidation in even the bravest of souls.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was late at night when the Varden finally finished their preparations and Nasuada ordered the men, dwarves, and Urgals to bed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Retiring to his tent, Eragon meditated until his mind was clear, as had become his habit. Instead of practicing his penmanship afterward, he spent the next few hours reviewing the spells he thought he might need the following day, as well as inventing new ones to address the specific challenges Dras-Leona presented.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he felt ready for the battle to come, he abandoned himself to his waking dreams, which were more varied and energetic than usual, for despite his meditation, the prospect of the approaching action stirred his blood and would not allow him to relax. As always, the waiting and the uncertainty were the most difficult parts for him to bear, and he wished he were already in the midst of the fray, where he would have no time to worry about what might happen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira was equally restless. From her, he caught snatches of dreams that involved biting and tearing, and he could tell that she was looking forward to the fierce pleasure of battle. Her mood influenced his to a certain degree, but not enough to make him entirely forget his apprehension.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">All too soon, morning arrived, and the Varden assembled before the exposed outskirts of Dras-Leona. The army was an imposing <span>sight</span>, but Eragon’s admiration was tempered by his observation of the warriors’ notched swords, dented helms, and battered shields, as well as the poorly repaired rents in their padded tunics and mail hauberks. If they succeeded in capturing Dras-Leona, they would be able to replace some of their equipment—as they had at Belatona, and before that, Feinster—but there was no replacing the men who bore them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The longer this drags on</span>, he said to Saphira, <span class="italic">the easier it will be for Galbatorix to defeat us when we arrive at Urû’baen</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then we must not delay</span>, she replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon sat astride her, next to Nasuada, who was garbed in full armor and mounted upon her fiery black charger, Battle-storm. Arrayed around them were his twelve elven guards, as well as an equal number of Nasuada’s guards, the Nighthawks, increased from her normal allotment of six for the duration of the battle. The elves were on foot—for they refused to ride any steeds but those they had raised and trained themselves—while all of the Nighthawks were mounted, including the Urgals. Ten yards to the right were King Orrin and his hand-picked retinue of warriors, each of whom had a colorful plume attached to the crest of his helm. Narheim, the commander of the dwarves, and Garzhvog were both with their respective troops.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After exchanging nods, Nasuada and King Orrin spurred their mounts forward and trotted away from the main body of the Varden, toward the city. With his left hand, Eragon clutched the neck spike in front of him as Saphira followed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada and King Orrin drew to a halt before they passed among the ramshackle buildings. At their signal, two heralds—one carrying the Varden’s standard, the other Surda’s—rode forth up the narrow street that ran through the maze of hovels to Dras-Leona’s southern gate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon frowned as he watched the heralds advance. The city seemed unnaturally empty and quiet. No one was visible in the <span>whole</span> of Dras-Leona, not even upon the battlements of the thick yellow wall, where hundreds of Galbatorix’s soldiers ought to be stationed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The air smells wrong</span>, said Saphira, and she growled ever so slightly, drawing Nasuada’s attention.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the base of the wall, the Varden’s herald called forth in a voice that carried all the way back to Eragon and Saphira: “Hail! In the name of Lady Nasuada of the Varden and King Orrin of Surda, as well as all free peoples of Alagaësia, we bid you open your gates so we may deliver a message of import unto your lord and master, Marcus Tábor. By it, he may hope to profit greatly, as may every man, woman, and child within Dras-Leona.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From behind the wall, a man who could not be seen replied: “These gates shall not open. State your message where you stand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Speak you for Lord Tábor?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then we charge you to remind him that discussions of statesmanship are more properly pursued in the privacy of one’s own chambers rather than in the open, where any might hear.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I take no orders from you, lackey! Deliver your message—and quickly, too!—ere I lose patience and fill you with arrows.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was impressed; the herald did not appear flustered or cowed by the threat but continued without hesitation. “As you wish. Our liegelords offer peace and friendship to Lord Tábor and all the people of Dras-Leona. We have no argument with you, only with Galbatorix, and we would not fight you if we had the choice. Have we not a common cause? Many of us once lived in the Empire, and we left only because Galbatorix’s cruel reign drove us from our lands. We are your kin, in blood and in spirit. Join forces with us, and we may yet free ourselves of the usurper who now sits in Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Should you accept our offer, our liegelords do guarantee the safety of Lord Tábor and his family, as well as whoever else may now be in the service of the Empire, although none will be allowed <span>to</span> maintain their position if they have given oaths that cannot be broken. And if your oaths will not let you aid us, then at least do not hinder us. Raise your gates and lay down your swords, and we promise you will come to no harm. But try to bar us, and we shall sweep you aside like so much chaff, for none can withstand the might of our army, nor that of Eragon Shadeslayer and the dragon Saphira.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the sound of her name, Saphira raised her head and loosed a terrifying roar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Above the gate, Eragon saw a tall, cloaked figure climb onto the battlements and stand between two merlons, staring over the heralds toward Saphira. Eragon squinted, but he could not make out the man’s face. Four other black-robed people joined the man, and those Eragon knew for priests of Helgrind by their truncated forms: one was missing a forearm, two were missing a leg each, and the last of their company was missing an arm <span class="italic">and</span> both legs, and was carried by his or her companions on a small padded litter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The cloaked man threw back his head and uttered a peal of laughter that crashed and boomed with thunderous force. Below him, the heralds struggled to control their mounts as the horses reared and tried to bolt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s stomach sank, and he gripped the hilt of Brisingr, ready to draw it at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“None can withstand your might?” said the man, his voice echoing off the buildings. “You have an overly high opinion of yourselves, I think.” And with a gigantic bellow, the glittering red mass of Thorn leaped from the streets below onto the roof of a house, piercing the wooden shingles with his talons. The dragon spread his huge, claw-tipped wings, opened his crimson maw, and raked the sky with a sheet of rippling flame.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In a mocking voice, Murtagh—for it <span class="italic">was</span> Murtagh, Eragon realized—added, “Dash yourselves against the walls all you want; you will never take Dras-Leona, not so long as Thorn and I are here to defend it. Send your finest warriors and magicians to fight us, and <span>they</span> will die, each and every one. That I promise. There isn’t a man among you who can best us. Not even you … <span class="italic">Brother</span>. Run back to your hiding places before it is too late, and pray that Galbatorix does not venture forth to deal with you himself. Otherwise, death and sorrow will be your only reward.”</span></p>
