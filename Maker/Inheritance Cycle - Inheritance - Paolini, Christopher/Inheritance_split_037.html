<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON SHOOK HIMSELF</span></span> as if waking from a bad dream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Now that he no longer had to fight off the High Priest, he gradually became aware that the priory bell was tolling—a loud, insistent sound that reminded him of when the Ra’zac had chased him from the cathedral during his first visit to Dras-Leona, with Brom.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Murtagh and Thorn will be here soon</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">We have to leave before then</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He sheathed Tinkledeath and handed it to Angela. “Here,” he said, “I think you’ll want this.” Then he pulled the corpses of the novitiates aside until he uncovered Brisingr. As his hand closed around the hilt, a sense of relief swept through him. Though the herbalist’s sword was a good and dangerous blade, it was not <span class="italic">his</span> weapon. Without Brisingr, he felt exposed, vulnerable—the same as he did whenever he and Saphira were apart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took him another few moments of searching to find his ring, which had rolled under one of the pews, and his necklace, which was wrapped around one of the handles of the bier. Among the pile of bodies, he also discovered Arya’s sword, which she was pleased to recover. But of his belt, the belt of Beloth the Wise, there was no sign.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked under all the nearby pews, and he even ran back to the altar and inspected the area around it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s not here,” he finally said, despairing. He turned toward the freestanding wall that hid the entrance to the underground chambers. “They must have left it in the tunnels.” He cast his gaze in the direction of the priory. “Or maybe …” He hesitated, torn between the two options.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Muttering the words under his breath, he cast a spell designed to find and lead him to the belt, but the only result he received was an image of smooth gray emptiness. As he had feared, there were wards around the belt that protected it from magical observation or interference, just as similar wards protected Brisingr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon scowled and took a half step toward the freestanding wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The bell tolled louder than ever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eragon,” called Arya from the other end of the cathedral, shifting the unconscious novitiate from one shoulder to the other. “We have to go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oromis would understand. It’s not your fault.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Leave it! The belt has been lost before. We will find it again. But for now, we must fly. Hurry!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon cursed, spun around, and ran to join Arya, Angela, and Solembum at the front of the cathedral. <span class="italic">Of all the things to lose</span> … It seemed almost sacrilegious to abandon the belt when so many creatures had died to fill it with energy. Besides, he had a horrible feeling that he might have need of that energy before the day was out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even as he and the herbalist pushed open the heavy doors that led out of the cathedral, Eragon sent his mind questing for Saphira, who he knew would be circling high above the city, waiting for him to contact her. The time for discretion had long since passed, and Eragon no longer cared if Murtagh or some other magician sensed his presence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He soon felt the familiar touch of Saphira’s consciousness. As their thoughts melded together once again, a certain tightness in Eragon’s chest vanished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What took you so long</span>? exclaimed Saphira. He could taste her worry, and he knew she had been considering descending upon Dras-Leona and tearing it to pieces in search of him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He poured his memories into her, sharing everything that had <span>happened</span> to him since they parted. The process took a few seconds, by which time he, Arya, Angela, and the werecat had exited the cathedral and were running down the front steps.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without pausing to give Saphira an opportunity to make sense of his jumbled recollections, Eragon said, <span class="italic">We need a distraction—now!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She acknowledged his statement, and he could feel her tip into a steep dive.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Also, tell Nasuada to start her attack. We’ll be at the south gate in a few minutes. If the Varden aren’t there when we open it, I don’t know how we’re going to escape</span>.</span></p>
