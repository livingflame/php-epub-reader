<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">AFRAID BUT DETERMINED</span></span>, Eragon strode forward with Arya, Elva, and Saphira toward the dais where Galbatorix sat relaxed upon his throne.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was a long walk, long enough that Eragon had time to consider a number of strategies, most of which he discarded as impractical. He knew that strength alone would not be enough to defeat the king; it would require cunning as well, and that was the one thing he felt he most lacked. Still, they had no choice now but to confront Galbatorix.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The two rows of lanterns that led to the dais were wide enough apart that the four of them were able to walk side by side. For that Eragon was glad, as it meant Saphira would be able to fight next to them if need be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they approached the throne, Eragon continued to study the chamber around them. It was, he thought, a strange room for a king to receive guests in. Aside from the bright path that lay before them, most of the space was hidden within impenetrable gloom—even more so than the halls of the dwarves beneath Tronjheim and Farthen Dûr—and the air contained a dry, musky scent that seemed familiar, even though he could not place it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Where is Shruikan?” he said in an undertone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira sniffed. <span class="italic">I can smell him, but I don’t hear him</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elva frowned. “Nor can I feel him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When they were perhaps thirty feet from the dais, they halted. Behind the throne hung thick black curtains made of velvety material, which stretched up toward the ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A shadow lay over Galbatorix, concealing his features. Then he leaned forward, into the light, and Eragon saw his face. It was long and lean, with a deep brow and a bladelike nose. His eyes were hard as stones, and they showed little white around the irises. His mouth was thin and wide with a slight downturn at the corners, and he had a close-cropped beard and mustache, which, like his clothes, were black as pitch. In age, he appeared to be in his fourth decade: still at the height of his strength, yet near the beginning of his decline. There were lines on his brow and on either side of his nose, and his tanned skin had a thin look to it, as if he had eaten nothing but rabbit meat and turnips through the winter. His shoulders were broad and well built, and his waist trim.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Upon his head was a crown of reddish gold set with all manner of jewels. The crown appeared old—older even than the hall, and Eragon wondered if perhaps it had once belonged to King Palancar, many hundreds of years ago.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On Galbatorix’s lap rested his sword. It was a Rider’s sword, that much was obvious, but Eragon had never seen its like before. The blade, hilt, and crossguard were stark white, while the gem within the pommel was as clear as a mountain spring. Altogether, there was something about the weapon that Eragon found unsettling. Its color—or rather its <span class="italic">lack</span> of color—reminded him of a sun-bleached bone. It was the color of death, not life, and it seemed far more dangerous than any shade of black, be it ever so dark.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix examined them each in turn with his sharp, unblinking gaze. “So, you have come to kill me,” he said. “Well then, shall we begin?” He lifted his sword and spread his arms to either side in a welcoming gesture.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon widened his stance and raised his sword and shield. The king’s invitation unsettled him. <span class="italic">He’s playing with us</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Still keeping hold of the Dauthdaert, Elva stepped forward and began to speak. However, no sound came from her mouth, and she looked at Eragon with an expression of alarm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon tried to touch her mind with his own, but he could feel nothing of her thoughts; it was as if she were no longer in the room with them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix laughed, then returned his sword to his lap and leaned back in his throne. “Did you truly believe that I was ignorant of your ability, child? Did you really think you could render me helpless with such a petty, transparent trick? Oh, I have no doubt your words could harm me, but only if I can hear them.” His bloodless lips curved in a cruel, humorless smile. “Such folly. <span class="italic">This</span> is the extent of your plan? A girl who cannot speak unless I grant her leave, a spear more suited for hanging on a wall than carrying into battle, and a collection of Eldunarí half out of their minds with age? Tut-tut. I had thought better of you, Arya. And you, Glaedr, but then I suppose your emotions have clouded your reason since I used Murtagh to slay Oromis.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To Eragon, Saphira, and Arya, Glaedr said, <span class="italic">Kill him</span>. The golden dragon felt perfectly calm, but his very serenity betrayed an anger that surpassed all other emotions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon exchanged a quick glance with Arya and Saphira, and then the three of them started toward the dais, even as Glaedr, Umaroth, and the other Eldunarí attacked Galbatorix’s mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before Eragon managed to take more than a few steps, the king rose up from his velvet seat and shouted a Word. The Word reverberated within Eragon’s mind, and every part of his being seemed to thrum in response, as if he were an instrument upon which a bard had struck a chord. Despite the intensity of his response, Eragon was unable to remember the Word; it faded from his mind, leaving behind only the knowledge of its existence and how it had affected him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix uttered other words after the first, but none seemed to have the same power, and Eragon was too dazed to comprehend their meaning. As the last phrase left the king’s lips, a force gripped Eragon, stopping him in mid-stride. The jolt shook a yelp of surprise from him. He tried to move, but his body might as well have been <span>encased</span> in stone. All he could do was breathe, look, and as he had already discovered, speak.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He did not understand; his wards should have protected him from the king’s magic. That they did not left him feeling as if he were teetering on the edge of a vast abyss.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Next to him, Saphira, Arya, and Elva appeared likewise immobilized.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Enraged by how easily the king had caught them, Eragon joined his mind with the Eldunarí as they battered at Galbatorix’s consciousness. He felt a vast number of minds opposing them—dragons all, who crooned and babbled and shrieked in a mad, disjointed chorus that contained such pain and sorrow, Eragon wanted to pull himself away lest they drag him down into their insanity. They were strong too, as if most of them had been Glaedr’s size or larger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The opposing dragons made it impossible to attack Galbatorix directly. Every time Eragon thought he felt the touch of the king’s thoughts, one of the enslaved dragons would throw itself at Eragon’s mind and—gibbering all the while—force him to retreat. Fighting the dragons was difficult on account of their wild and incoherent thoughts; subduing any one of them was like trying to hold down a rabid wolf. And there were so many of them, far more than the Riders had hidden in the Vault of Souls.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before either side could gain the advantage, Galbatorix, who seemed entirely unaffected by the invisible struggle, said, “Come out, my dears, and meet our guests.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A boy and a girl emerged from behind the throne and came to stand by the king’s right hand. The girl looked about six, the boy perhaps eight or nine. They shared a close resemblance, and Eragon guessed they were brother and sister. Both were dressed in their night garments. The girl clung to the boy’s arm and half hid behind him, while the boy appeared frightened but determined. Even as he struggled against Galbatorix’s Eldunarí, Eragon could feel the minds of the children—could feel their terror and confusion—and he knew they were real.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Isn’t she charming?” asked Galbatorix, lifting the girl’s chin with one long finger. “Such large eyes and such pretty hair. And isn’t he a handsome young lad?” He put his hand on the boy’s shoulder. “Children, it is said, are a blessing to us all. I do not happen to share that belief. It has been my experience that children are every bit as cruel and vindictive as adults. They only lack the strength to subjugate others to their will.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Perhaps you agree with me, perhaps you don’t. Regardless, I know that you of the Varden pride yourselves on your virtue. You see yourselves as upholders of justice, defenders of the innocent—as if any are truly innocent—and as noble warriors fighting to right an ancient wrong. Very well, then; let us test your convictions and see if you are what you claim to be. Unless you stop your attack, I shall kill these two”—he shook the boy’s shoulder—“and I shall kill them if you dare attack me again. … In fact, if you displease me excessively, I shall kill them anyway, so I advise you to be courteous.” The boy and the girl appeared sick at his words, but they made no attempt to flee.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked over at Arya, and he saw his despair mirrored in her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Umaroth!</span> they cried out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No</span>, growled the white dragon, even as he wrestled with the mind of another Eldunarí.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You have to stop</span>, said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">He’ll kill them</span>, said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No! We will not give up. Not now!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Enough!</span> roared Glaedr. <span class="italic">There are hatchlings in danger!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And more hatchlings will be in danger if we do not kill the Egg-breaker</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, but now is the wrong time to try</span>, said Arya. <span class="italic">Wait a little while, and perhaps we can find a way to attack him without risking the lives of the children</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And if not</span>? asked Umaroth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Neither Eragon nor Arya could bring themselves to answer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then we will do what we must</span>, said Saphira. Eragon hated it, but he knew she was right. They could not place the two children before the whole of Alagaësia. If possible, they would save the boy and the girl, but if not, then they would still attack. They had no other choice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Umaroth and the Eldunarí he spoke for grudgingly subsided, Galbatorix smiled. “There, that’s better. Now we may speak as civilized beings, without worrying about who is trying to kill whom.” He patted the boy on the head and then pointed toward the steps of the dais. “Sit.” Without arguing, the two children settled on the lowest step, as far from the king as they could get. Then Galbatorix motioned and said, “Kausta,” and Eragon slid forward until he was standing at the base of the dais, as did Arya, Elva, and Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon continued to be bewildered that their wards were not protecting them. He thought of the Word—whatever it might have been—and a horrible suspicion began to take root within him. Hopelessness quickly followed. For all their plans, for all their talking and worrying and suffering, for all their sacrifices, Galbatorix had captured them as easily as he might a litter of newborn kittens. And if Eragon’s suspicion was true, the king was even more formidable than they had suspected.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Still, they were not entirely helpless. Their minds were, for the moment, their own. And so far as he could tell, they could still use magic … one way or another.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix’s gaze settled upon Eragon. “So you are the one who has given me so much trouble, Eragon, son of Morzan. … You and I should have met long ago. Had your mother not been so foolish as to hide you in Carvahall, you would have grown up here, in Urû’baen, as a child of the nobility, with all the riches and responsibilities that entails, instead of whiling away your days grubbing in the dirt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Be that as it may, you are here now, and those things shall at last be yours. They are your birthright, your inheritance, and I shall see to it that you receive them.” He seemed to study Eragon with greater intensity, and then he said, “You look more like your mother than <span>your</span> father. With Murtagh, the opposite holds true. Still, it matters little. Whichever one you resemble most, it is only right that you and your brother should serve me, even as did your parents.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Never,” said Eragon with a clenched jaw.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A thin smile appeared on the king’s face. “Never? We shall see.” His gaze shifted. “And you, Saphira. Of all my guests today, I am gladdest to see you. You have grown to a fine adulthood. Do you remember this place? Do you remember the sound of my voice? I spent many a night talking to you and the other eggs in my charge during the years when I was securing my rule over the Empire.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I … I remember a little</span>, said Saphira, and Eragon relayed her words to the king. She did not want to communicate directly with the king, nor would the king have allowed it. Keeping their minds separate was the best way to protect themselves when not in open conflict.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix nodded. “And I am sure you will remember more the longer you stay within these walls. You may not have been fully aware of it at the time, but you spent most of your life in a room not far from here. This is your home, Saphira. It is where you belong. And it is where you will build your nest and lay your eggs.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira’s eyes narrowed, and Eragon felt a strange yearning from her, mixed with a burning hatred.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king moved on. “Arya Dröttningu. Fate, it seems, has a sense of humor, for here you are, even as I ordered you to be brought so long ago. Your path was a roundabout one, but still you have come, and of your own accord. I find that rather amusing. Don’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya pressed her lips together and refused to answer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix chuckled. “I admit you have been a thorn in my side for quite some time now. You’ve not caused as much mischief as that bumbling meddler Brom, but neither have you been idle. One might even say that this whole situation is your fault, as it was you who sent Saphira’s egg to Eragon. However, I hold no enmity toward you. If not for you, Saphira might not have hatched and I <span>might</span> never have been able to flush the last of my enemies from hiding. For that, I thank you.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And then there is you, Elva. The girl with the sigil of a Rider upon her brow. Dragon-marked and blessed with the wherewithal to perceive all that pains a person and all that <span class="italic">will</span> pain them. How you must have suffered these past months. How you must despise those around you for their weaknesses, even as you are forced to share in their misery. The Varden have used you poorly. Today I shall end the battles that have so tormented you, and you shall no longer have to endure the mistakes and misfortunes of others. That I promise. On occasion, I may have need of your skill, but in the main, you may live as you please, and peace shall be yours.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elva frowned, but it was obvious that the king’s offer tempted her. Listening to Galbatorix, Eragon realized, could be as dangerous as listening to Elva herself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix paused and fingered the wire-wrapped hilt of his sword while he regarded them with a hooded gaze. Then he looked past them toward the point in the air where the Eldunarí floated hidden from sight, and his mood seemed to darken. “Convey my words to Umaroth as I speak them,” he said. “Umaroth! We are ill met once again. I thought I killed you on Vroengard.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Umaroth responded, and Eragon began to relay his words: “He says—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“—that you killed only his body,” Arya finished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That much is obvious,” said Galbatorix. “Where did the Riders hide you and those with you? On Vroengard? Or was it elsewhere? My servants and I searched the ruins of Doru Araeba most closely.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hesitated to deliver the dragon’s answer, as it was sure to displease the king, but he could think of no other option. “He says … that he will never share that information with you of his own free will.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix’s eyebrows met above his nose. “Does he now? Well, he’ll tell me soon enough, whether he wishes to or not.” The king <span>tapped</span> the pommel of his glaringly white sword. “I took this blade from his Rider, you know, when I killed him—when I killed Vrael—in the watchtower that overlooks Palancar Valley. Vrael had his own name for this sword. He called it Islingr, ‘Light-bringer.’ I thought Vrangr was more … appropriate.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Vrangr</span> meant “awry,” and Eragon agreed that it fitted the sword better.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A dull boom sounded behind them, and Galbatorix smiled again. “Ah, good. Murtagh and Thorn shall be joining us shortly, and then we can begin properly.” Another sound filled the chamber, then a great gusting noise that seemed to come from several directions at once. Galbatorix glanced over his shoulder and said, “It was inconsiderate of you to attack so early in the morning. I was already awake—I rise well before dawn—but you woke Shruikan. He gets rather irritated when he’s tired, and when he’s irritated, he tends to eat people. My guards learned long ago not to disturb him when he’s resting. You would have done well to follow their example.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Galbatorix spoke, the curtains behind his throne shifted and rose toward the ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a sense of shock, Eragon realized that they were actually Shruikan’s wings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The black dragon lay curled on the floor with his head close to the throne, the bulk of his massive body forming a wall too steep and too high for any to climb without magic. His scales had not the radiance of Saphira’s or Thorn’s but rather sparkled with a dark, liquid brilliance. Their inky color made them almost opaque, which gave them an appearance of strength and solidity that Eragon had not seen in a dragon’s scales before; it was as if Shruikan were plated with stone or metal, not gems.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The dragon was enormous. Eragon at first had difficulty comprehending that the entire shape before them was a single living creature. He saw part of Shruikan’s corded neck and thought he was seeing the main part of the dragon’s body; he saw the side of one of Shruikan’s hind feet and mistook it for a shin. A fold of a wing <span>was</span> an entire wing in his mind. Only when he looked up and found the spikes atop the dragon’s spine did Eragon grasp the full extent of Shruikan’s size. Each spike was as wide as the trunk of an ancient oak tree; the scales surrounding them were a foot thick, if not more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Shruikan opened an eye and looked down at them. His iris was a pale blue white, the color of a high mountain glacier, and it appeared startlingly bright amid the black of his scales.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The dragon’s huge slitted orb darted back and forth as he studied their faces. His gaze seemed to contain nothing but fury and madness, and Eragon felt certain that Shruikan would kill them in an instant if Galbatorix allowed it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The stare of the enormous eye—especially when it held such evident malice—made Eragon want to run and hide in a burrow deep, deep underground. It was, he imagined, very much how a rabbit must feel when confronted by a large, toothy creature.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Beside him, Saphira growled, and the scales along her back rippled and lifted like hackles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In response, jets of fire appeared in the yawning pits of Shruikan’s nostrils, and then he growled as well, drowning out Saphira and filling the chamber with a rumble like that of a rockslide.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On the dais, the two children squeaked and curled into balls, tucking their heads between their knees.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Peace, Shruikan,” said Galbatorix, and the black dragon grew silent again. His eyelid descended, but it did not close completely; the dragon continued to watch them through a gap a few inches wide, as if waiting for the right moment to pounce.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He does not like you,” said Galbatorix. “But then, he does not like anyone … do you now, Shruikan?” The dragon snorted, and the smell of smoke tinged the air.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Hopelessness again overwhelmed Eragon. Shruikan could kill Saphira with a bat of his paw. And as large as the chamber was, it was still too small for Saphira to evade the great black dragon for long.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His hopelessness turned to frustrated rage, and he wrenched at <span>his</span> invisible bonds. “How is it you can do this?” he shouted, straining every muscle in his body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would like to know that as well,” said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix’s eyes seemed to gleam beneath the dark eaves of his brow. “Can you not guess, elfling?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would prefer an answer to a guess,” she replied.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Very well. But first you must do something so that you may know that what I say is indeed the truth. You must try to cast a spell, both of you, and then I shall tell you.” When neither Eragon nor Arya made to speak, the king gestured with his hand. “Go on; I promise that I will not punish you for it. Now try. … I insist.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya went first. “Thrautha,” she said, her voice hard and low. She was, Eragon guessed, trying to send the Dauthdaert flying toward Galbatorix. The weapon, however, remained fixed to her hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon spoke: “Brisingr!” He thought that perhaps his bond with his sword would allow him to use magic where Arya could not, but to his disappointment, the blade remained as it was, glittering dimly in the dull light of the lanterns.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix’s gaze grew more intense. “The answer must be obvious to you now, elfling. It has taken me most of the past century, but at long last I have found what I was searching for: a means of governing the spellcasters of Alagaësia. The search was not easy; most men would have given up in frustration or, if they had the required patience, fear. But not I. I persisted. And through my study, I discovered what I had for so long desired: a tablet written in another land and another age, by hands that were neither elf nor dwarf nor human nor Urgal. And upon that tablet, there was scribed a certain Word—a name that magicians throughout the ages have hunted for with nothing but bitter disappointment as their reward.” Galbatorix lifted a finger. “The name of all names. The name of the ancient language.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon bit back a curse. He had been right. <span class="italic">That’s what the Ra’zac was trying to tell me</span>, he thought, remembering what one of the <span>insect</span>-like monsters had said to him in Helgrind: “He has almossst found the <span class="italic">name</span>. … The true <span class="italic">name</span>!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As disheartening as Galbatorix’s revelation was, Eragon clung to the knowledge that the name could not stop him or Arya—or Saphira for that matter—from using magic <span class="italic">without</span> the ancient language. Not that it would do much good. The king’s wards were sure to protect him and Shruikan from any spells they might cast. Still, if the king did not know that it was possible to use magic without the ancient language, or even if he did but he believed that <span class="italic">they</span> did not, then they might be able to surprise him and maybe distract him for a moment, although Eragon was not sure how that might help.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix continued: “With this Word, I can reshape spells as easily as another magician might command the elements. All spells shall be subject to me, but I am subject to none, except for those of my choosing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Perhaps he</span> doesn’t <span class="italic">know</span>, Eragon thought, a spark of determination kindling in his heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I shall use the name of names to bring every magician in Alagaësia to heel, and no one shall cast a spell but with my blessing, not even the elves. At this very moment, the magicians of your army are discovering the truth of this. Once they venture a certain distance into Urû’baen, past the front gate, their spells cease to work as they should. Some of their enchantments fail outright, while others twist and end up affecting your troops instead of mine.” Galbatorix tilted his head and his gaze grew distant, as if he were listening to someone whispering in his ear. “It has caused much confusion among their ranks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon fought the urge to spit at the king. “It doesn’t matter,” he growled. “We’ll still find a way to stop you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix seemed grimly amused. “Is that so. How? And why? Think what you are saying. You would stop the first opportunity that Alagaësia has had for true peace in order to sate your over-developed sense of vengeance? You would allow magicians <span>everywhere</span> to continue to have their way, regardless of the harm they cause others? That seems far worse than anything I have done. But this is idle speculation. The finest warriors of the Riders could not defeat me, and you are far from their equal. You never had any hope of overthrowing me. None of you did.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I killed Durza, and I killed the Ra’zac,” said Eragon. “Why not you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I am not as weak as those who serve me. You could not even trounce Murtagh, and he is but a shadow of a shadow. Your father, Morzan, was far more powerful than either of you, and even he could not withstand my might. Besides,” said Galbatorix as a cruel expression settled on his face, “you are mistaken if you think you destroyed the Ra’zac. The eggs in Dras-Leona weren’t the only ones I took from the Lethrblaka. I have others, hidden elsewhere. Soon they shall hatch, and soon the Ra’zac shall once more roam the earth to do my bidding. As for Durza, Shades are easy to make, and they are often more trouble than they are worth. So you see, you have won <span class="italic">nothing</span>, boy—nothing but false victories.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Above all, Eragon hated Galbatorix’s smugness and his air of overwhelming superiority. He wanted to rage at the king and curse him with every oath he knew, but for the sake of the children’s safety, he held his tongue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Do you have any ideas</span>? he asked Saphira, Arya, and Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No</span>, said Saphira. The others remained silent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Umaroth</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Only that we should attack while we still can</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A minute passed wherein no one spoke. Galbatorix leaned on one elbow and rested his chin on his fist while he continued to watch them. By his feet, the boy and the girl cried softly. Above, Shruikan’s eye remained fixed on Eragon and those with him, like a great ice-blue lantern.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then they heard the doors to the chamber open and close, and the sound of approaching footsteps—the footsteps of both a man and a dragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh and Thorn soon appeared in their field of vision. They stopped next to Saphira, and Murtagh bowed. “Sir.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king motioned, and Murtagh and Thorn walked over to the right of the throne.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Murtagh took up his position, he gave Eragon a look of disgust; then he clasped his hands behind his back and stared toward the far end of the chamber, ignoring him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You took longer than I expected,” said Galbatorix in a deceptively mild voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without looking, Murtagh said, “The gate was more damaged than I originally thought, sir, and the spells you placed on it made it difficult to repair.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you mean that it’s my fault you are tardy?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh’s jaw tightened. “No, sir. I only mean to explain. Also, part of the hallway was rather … messy, and that slowed us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I see. We shall speak of this later, but for now, there are other matters we must attend to. For one, it is time our guests meet the final member of our party. Moreover, it is high time we had some proper light in here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And Galbatorix struck the flat of his blade against one arm of his throne, and in a deep voice, he cried, “Naina!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At his command, hundreds of lanterns sprang to life along the walls of the chamber, bathing it with warm, candle-like illumination. The room was still dim about the corners, but for the first time Eragon could make out the details of their surroundings. Scores of pillars and doorways lined the walls, and all about were sculptures and paintings and gilt scrollwork. Gold and silver had been used with abundance, and Eragon glimpsed the sparkle of many jewels. It was a staggering display of wealth, even when compared with the riches of Tronjheim or Ellesméra.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a moment, he noticed something else: a block of gray stone—granite perhaps—eight feet tall, which stood off to their right, beyond where the light had previously reached. And chained standing to the block was Nasuada, wearing a simple white tunic. <span>She</span> was watching them with wide-open eyes, though she could not speak, for a knotted cloth was tied over her mouth. She looked worn and tired but otherwise healthy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Relief shot through Eragon. He had not dared hope to find her alive. “Nasuada!” he shouted. “Are you all right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Has he forced you to swear fealty to him?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She shook her head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you think I would let her tell you if I had?” asked Galbatorix. As Eragon looked back at the king, he saw Murtagh cast a quick, concerned glance toward Nasuada, and he wondered at its significance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well, have you?” Eragon asked in a challenging tone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“As it so happens, no. I decided to wait until I had gathered all of you together. Now that I have, none shall leave until you have pledged yourself in service to me, nor shall you leave until I have learned the true name of each and every one of you. <span class="italic">That</span> is why you are here. Not to kill me, but to bow down before me and to finally put an end to this noisome rebellion.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira growled again, and Eragon said, “We won’t give in.” Even to his own ears, his words seemed weak and toothless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then they will die,” Galbatorix replied, pointing at the two children. “And in the end, your defiance will change nothing. You do not seem to understand; you have already lost. Outside, the battle fares badly for your friends. Soon my men will force them to surrender, and this war will arrive at its destined conclusion. Fight if you wish. Deny what is before you if it comforts you. But nothing you do can change your fate, or that of Alagaësia.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon refused to believe that he and Saphira would have to spend the rest of their lives answering to Galbatorix. Saphira felt the same, and her anger joined with his, burning away every last bit of his fear and caution, and he said, “Vae weohnata ono vergarí, eka thäet otherúm.” We will kill you, I swear it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a moment, Galbatorix appeared aggravated; then he spoke <span>the</span> Word again—as well as other words in the ancient language besides—and the vow Eragon had uttered seemed to lose all meaning; the words lay in his mind like a handful of dead leaves, devoid of any power to impel or inspire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king’s upper lip curved in a sneer. “Swear all the oaths you want. They shall not bind you, not unless I allow them to.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’ll still kill you,” Eragon muttered. He understood that if he continued to resist, it might mean the lives of the two children, but Galbatorix <span class="italic">had</span> to be killed, and if the price of his death was the deaths of the boy and the girl, then that was a cost Eragon was willing to accept. He knew he would hate himself for it. He knew that he would see the faces of the children in his dreams for the rest of his life. But if he did not challenge Galbatorix, then all would be lost.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Do not hesitate</span>, said Umaroth. <span class="italic">Now is the time to strike</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon raised his voice. “Why won’t you fight me? Are you a coward? Or are you too weak to match yourself against me? Is that why you hide behind these children like a frightened old woman?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Eragon</span> …, said Arya in a warning tone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I am not the only one who brought a child here today,” replied the king, the lines on his face deepening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There is a difference: Elva agreed to come. But you didn’t answer the question. Why won’t you fight? Is it that you’ve spent so long sitting on your throne and eating sweets that you’ve forgotten how to swing a sword?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You would not want to fight me, youngling,” growled the king.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Prove it, then. Release me and meet me in honest battle. Show that you are still a warrior to be reckoned with. Or live with the knowledge that you are a sniveling coward who dares not face even a single opponent without the help of your Eldunarí. You killed Vrael himself! Why should you fear me? Why should—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Enough!” said Galbatorix. A flush had crept onto his hollow cheeks. Then, like quicksilver, his mood changed, and he bared his teeth in a fearsome approximation of a smile. He rapped the arm of <span>his</span> seat with his knuckles. “I did not gain this throne by accepting every challenge put to me. Nor have I held it by meeting my foes in ‘honest battle.’ What you have yet to learn, youngling, is that it does not matter how you achieve victory, only that you achieve it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re wrong. It does matter,” said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I will remind you of that when you are sworn to me. However …” Galbatorix tapped the pommel of his sword. “Since you wish so badly to fight, I will grant your request.” The flare of hope that Eragon felt vanished when Galbatorix added, “But not with me. With Murtagh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At those words, Murtagh flashed an angry look at Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king stroked the fringe of his beard. “I would like to know, once and for all, which of you is the better warrior. You will fight as you are, without magic or Eldunarí, until one of you is unable to continue. You may not kill each other—that I forbid—but short of death, I will allow most anything. It will be rather entertaining, I think, to watch brother fight brother.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Eragon. “Not brothers. Half brothers. Brom was my father, not Morzan.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For the first time, Galbatorix appeared surprised. Then one corner of his mouth twisted upward. “Of course. I should have seen it; the truth is in your face for any who know what to look for. This duel will be all the more fitting, then. The son of Brom pitted against the son of Morzan. Fate indeed has a sense of humor.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh also reacted with surprise. He controlled his face too well for Eragon to determine whether the information pleased or upset him, but Eragon knew that it had thrown him off balance. That had been his plan. If Murtagh was distracted, it would be that much easier for Eragon to defeat him. And he did intend to defeat him, regardless of the blood they shared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Letta,” said Galbatorix with a slight motion of his hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon staggered as the spell holding him vanished.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the king said, “Gánga aptr,” and Arya, Elva, and Saphira slid backward, leaving a wide space between them and the dais. The <span>king</span> muttered a few other words, and most of the lanterns in the chamber dimmed so that the area in front of the throne was the brightest spot in the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Come now,” said Galbatorix to Murtagh. “Join Eragon, and let us see which of you is the more skilled.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Scowling, Murtagh walked to a spot several yards from where Eragon stood. He drew Zar’roc—the blade of the crimson sword looked as if it were already coated in blood—then lifted his shield and settled into a crouch.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After glancing at Saphira and Arya, Eragon did the same.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Now fight!” cried Galbatorix, and clapped his hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Sweating, Eragon began to move toward Murtagh, even as Murtagh moved toward him.</span></p>
