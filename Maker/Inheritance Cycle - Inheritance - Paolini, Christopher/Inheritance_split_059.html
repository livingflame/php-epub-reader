<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON’S FOOT SLIPPED</span></span> out from under him as he stepped on a patch of slick mud, and he fell onto his side in the wet grass with brutal suddenness. He uttered a grunt and winced as his hip began to throb. The impact was sure to leave a bruise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Barzûl,” he said as he rolled to his feet and carefully stood. <span class="italic">At least I didn’t land on Brisingr</span>, he thought as he pried scales of cold mud from his leggings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Feeling glum, he resumed trudging toward the ruined building where they had decided to camp, in the belief it would be safer than by the forest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he strode through the grass, he startled a number of bullfrogs, who sprang out of hiding and fled hopping to either side. The bullfrogs were the only other strange creature they had encountered on the island; each had a hornlike projection above its reddish eyes, and from the center of its forehead sprouted a curving stalk—much like a fisherman’s rod—upon the end of which hung a small, fleshy organ that at night glowed either white or yellow. The light allowed the bullfrogs to lure hundreds of flying insects within the reach of their tongues, and as a result of their easy access to food, the frogs grew enormously large. He had seen some the size of a bear’s head, great fleshy lumps with staring eyes and mouths as wide as both his outstretched hands put together.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The frogs reminded him of Angela the herbalist, and he suddenly wished that she were there on Vroengard Island with them. <span class="italic">If anyone could tell us our true names, I bet she could</span>. For some reason, he always felt as if the herbalist could see right through him, as if she <span>understood</span> everything about him. It was a disconcerting sensation, but at the moment, he would have welcomed it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and Saphira had decided to trust Solembum and stay on Vroengard for another three days at most while they tried to discover their true names. Glaedr had left the decision up to them; he said, <span class="italic">You know Solembum better than I do. Stay or do not. Either way, the risk is great. There are no more safe paths</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was Saphira who ultimately made the choice. <span class="italic">The werecats would never serve Galbatorix</span>, she said. <span class="italic">They prize their freedom too highly. I would trust their word before that of any other creature, even an elf</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So they had stayed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They spent the rest of that day, and now most of the next, sitting, thinking, talking, sharing memories, examining each other’s minds, and trying various combinations of words in the ancient language, all in the hope that they would be able to either consciously work out their true names or—if they were lucky—strike upon them by accident.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Glaedr had offered his help when asked, but for the most part he kept to himself and gave Eragon and Saphira privacy for their conversations, many of which Eragon would have been embarrassed for anyone else to hear. <span class="italic">The finding of one’s true name ought to be something one does by oneself</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">If I think of either of yours, I will tell you—for we have no time to waste—but it would be better if you discover them on your own</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As of yet, neither of them had succeeded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Ever since Brom had explained to him about true names, Eragon had wanted to learn his own. Knowledge, particularly self-knowledge, was ever a useful thing, and he hoped his true name would allow him to better master his thoughts and feelings. Still, he could not help but feel a certain amount of trepidation about what he might discover.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Assuming that he <span class="italic">could</span> discover his name in the next few days, of <span>which</span> he was not entirely sure. He hoped he could, both for the success of their mission and because he did not want Glaedr or Saphira to figure it out for him. If he was to hear his whole being described in a word or phrase, then he wanted to arrive at that knowledge on his own, instead of having it thrust upon him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon sighed as he climbed the five broken steps that led up to the building. The structure had been a nesting house, or so Glaedr had said, and by the standards of Vroengard, it was so small as to be entirely unnoteworthy. Still, the walls were over three stories high, and the interior was large enough for Saphira to move about with ease. The southeastern corner had collapsed inward, taking part of the ceiling with it, but otherwise the building was sound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s steps echoed as he walked through the vaulted entryway and made his way across the glassy floor of the main chamber. Embedded within the transparent material were swirling blades of color that formed an abstract design of dizzying complexity. Every time he looked at it, he felt as if the lines were about to resolve into a recognizable shape, but they never did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The surface of the floor was covered with a fine web of cracks that radiated outward from the rubble beneath the gaping hole where the walls had given way. Long tendrils of ivy hung from the edges of the broken ceiling like lengths of knotted rope. Water dripped from the ends of the vines to fall into shallow, misshapen puddles, and the sound of the droplets striking echoed throughout the building, a constant, irregular beat that Eragon thought would drive him mad if he had to listen to it for more than a few days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Against the north-facing wall was a half circle of stones Saphira had dragged and pushed into place to protect their camp. When he reached the barrier, Eragon jumped onto the nearest block, which stood over six feet tall. Then he dropped down to the other side, landing heavily.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira paused in the midst of licking her forefoot, and he felt a questioning thought from her. He shook his head, and she returned to her grooming.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Undoing his cloak, Eragon walked over to the fire he had built close to the wall. He spread the sodden garment on the floor, then removed his mud-caked boots and set them out to dry as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Does it look as if it will start raining again</span>? Saphira asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Probably</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He squatted by the fire for a bit, and then sat on his bedroll and leaned against the wall. He watched Saphira as she worked her crimson tongue around the flexible cuticle at the base of each of her talons. An idea occurred to him, and he murmured a phrase in the ancient language, but to his disappointment, he felt no charge of energy in the words, nor did Saphira react to their utterance, as had Sloan when Eragon had spoken his true name.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon closed his eyes and tipped his head back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It frustrated him that he was unable to puzzle out Saphira’s true name. He could accept that he did not fully understand himself, but he had known Saphira since the moment she had hatched, and he had shared nearly all of her memories. How could there be parts of her that were still a mystery to him? How could he have been better able to understand a murderer like Sloan than his own spell-bonded partner? Was it because she was a dragon and he was a human? Was it because Sloan’s identity had been simpler than Saphira’s?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon did not know.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">One of the exercises he and Saphira had done—on Glaedr’s recommendation—was to tell each other all of the flaws they had noticed: he in her and she in him. It had been a humbling exercise. Glaedr had also shared his observations, and though the dragon had been kind, Eragon could not help but feel a sense of wounded pride upon hearing Glaedr list his various failings. And that too Eragon knew he needed to take into account when trying to discover his true name.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For Saphira, the hardest thing to come to terms with had been her vanity, which she had refused to acknowledge as such for the longest time. For Eragon, it had been the arrogance Glaedr claimed he sometimes displayed, his feelings concerning the men he had <span>killed</span>, and all the petulance, selfishness, anger, and other shortcomings to which he, like so many others, was prey.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And yet, though they had examined themselves as honestly as they could, their introspection had yielded no results.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Today and tomorrow, that’s all we have</span>. The thought of returning to the Varden empty-handed depressed him. <span class="italic">How are we supposed to best Galbatorix</span>? he wondered, as he had so many times before. <span class="italic">Another few days and our lives may no longer be our own. We’ll be slaves, like Murtagh and Thorn</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He swore under his breath and surreptitiously punched a fist against the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Be calm, Eragon</span>, said Glaedr, and Eragon noticed the dragon was shielding his thoughts so that Saphira did not hear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">How can I</span>? he growled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It is easy to be calm when there is nothing to worry about, Eragon. The true test of your self-control, however, is whether you can remain calm in a trying situation. You cannot allow anger or frustration to cloud your thoughts, not at the moment. Right now, you need your mind to be clear</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Have you always been able to remain calm at times like this</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The old dragon seemed to chuckle. <span class="italic">No. I used to growl and bite and knock down trees and tear up the ground. Once, I broke the top off of a mountain in the Spine; the other dragons were rather upset with me for that. But I have had many years to learn that losing my temper rarely helps. You have not, I know, but allow my experience to guide you in this. Let go of your worries and focus only on the task at hand. The future will be what it will, and fretting about it will only make your fears more likely to come true</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I know</span>, Eragon sighed, <span class="italic">but it’s not easy</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Of course not. Few things of worth are</span>. Then Glaedr withdrew and left him to the silence of his own mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon fetched his bowl from the saddlebags, hopped over the half circle of stones, and walked barefoot to one of the puddles underneath the opening in the ceiling. A light drizzle had begun to fall, coating that part of the floor with a slippery layer of water. He <span>squatted</span> by the edge of the puddle and began to scoop water into the bowl with his bare hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once the bowl was full, Eragon retreated a few feet and set it on a piece of stone that was the height of a table. Then he fixed an image of Roran in his mind and murmured, “Draumr kópa.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The water in the bowl shimmered, and an image of Roran appeared against a pure white background. He was walking next to Horst and Albriech, leading his horse, Snowfire. The three men looked tired and footsore, but they still carried weapons, so Eragon knew the Empire had not captured them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He next scryed Jörmundur, then Solembum—who was tearing at a freshly killed robin—and then Arya, but Arya’s wards hid her from his sight, and all he saw was blackness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last Eragon released the spell and tossed the water back into the puddle. As he climbed over the barrier surrounding their camp, Saphira stretched and yawned, arching her back like a cat, and said, <span class="italic">How are they</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Safe, as far as I can tell.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He dropped the bowl on the saddlebags, then lay on his bedroll, closed his eyes, and returned to scouring his mind for ideas as to what his true name might be. Every few minutes, he thought of a different possibility, but none touched a chord within him, so he discarded them and began anew. All of the names contained a few constants: the fact that he was a Rider; his affection for Saphira and Arya; his desire to vanquish Galbatorix; his relationships with Roran, Garrow, and Brom; and the blood he shared with Murtagh. But no matter in what combination he placed those elements, the name did not speak to him. It was obvious that he was missing some crucial aspect of himself, so he kept making the names longer and longer in the hope that he might stumble across whatever it was he was overlooking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When the names began to take him more than a minute to say, he realized he was wasting his time. He needed to reexamine his basic assumptions once again. He was convinced that his mistake <span>lay</span> in failing to notice some fault, or in not giving enough consideration to a fault he was already aware of. People, he had observed, were rarely willing to acknowledge their own imperfections, and he knew the same was true of himself. Somehow he had to cure himself of that blindness while he yet had time. It was a blindness born of pride and self-preservation, as it allowed him to believe the best of himself as he went about his life. However, he could no longer afford to indulge in such self-deception.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Thus he thought and continued to think as the day wore on, but his efforts met only with failure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The rain grew heavier. Eragon disliked the sound of it drumming against the puddles, for the featureless noise made it difficult to hear if anyone was trying to sneak up on them. Since their first night on Vroengard, he had seen no sign of the strange, hooded figures whom he had watched wending their way through the city, nor had he felt any hint of their minds. Nevertheless, Eragon remained conscious of their presence, and he could not help feeling that he and Saphira were about to be attacked at any moment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The gray light of day slowly faded to dusk, and a deep, starless night settled across the valley. Eragon heaped more wood onto the fire; it was the only illumination within the nesting house, and the cluster of yellow flames was like a tiny candle within the huge, echoing space. Close to the fire, the glassy floor reflected the glow of the burning branches. It gleamed like a sheet of polished ice, and the blades of color within often distracted Eragon from his brooding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon ate no dinner. He was hungry, but he was too tense for food to sit well in his stomach, and in any case, he felt that a meal would slow his thinking. Never was his mind so keen as when his belly was empty.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He would not, he decided, eat again until he knew his true name, or until they had to leave the island, whichever came first.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Several hours passed. They spoke little amongst themselves, although Eragon remained conscious of the general drift of Saphira’s moods and thoughts, even as she remained conscious of his.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then, as Eragon was about to enter into his waking dreams—both to rest and out of hope that the dreams might provide some insight—Saphira uttered a <span class="italic">yowl</span>, reached forward with her right paw, and slapped it upon the floor. Several branches within the fire crumbled and fell apart, sending a burst of sparks toward the black ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Alarmed, Eragon sprang to his feet and drew Brisingr while he searched the darkness beyond the half circle of stones for enemies. An instant later, he realized that Saphira’s mood was not one of concern or anger but of triumph.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I have done it!</span> exclaimed Saphira. She arched her neck and loosed a jet of blue and yellow flame into the upper reaches of the building. <span class="italic">I know my true name!</span> She spoke a single line in the ancient language, and the inside of Eragon’s mind seemed to ring with a sound like a bell, and for a moment, the tips of Saphira’s scales gleamed with an inner light, and she looked as if she were made of stars.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The name was grand and majestic, but also tinged with sadness, for it named her as the last female of her kind. In the words, Eragon could hear the love and devotion she felt for him, as well as all the other traits that made up her personality. Most he recognized; a few he did not. Her flaws were as prominent as her virtues, but overall, the impression was one of fire and beauty and grandeur.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira shivered from the tip of her nose to the tip of her tail, and she shuffled her wings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I know who I am</span>, she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Well done, Bjartskular</span>, said Glaedr, and Eragon could sense how impressed he was. <span class="italic">You have a name to be proud of. I would not say it again, however, not even to yourself, until we are at the … at the spire we have come to see. You must take great care to keep your name hidden now that you know it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira blinked and shuffled her wings again. <span class="italic">Yes, Master</span>. The excitement running through her was palpable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon sheathed Brisingr and walked over to her. She lowered her head until it was at his level. He stroked the line of her jaw, <span>and</span> then pressed his forehead against her hard snout and held her as tightly as he could, her scales sharp against his fingers. Hot tears began to slide down his cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why do you cry</span>? she asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Because … I’m lucky enough to be bonded with you</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Little one</span>.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">They talked for a while longer, as Saphira was eager to discuss what she had learned about herself. Eragon was happy to listen, but he could not help feeling a little bitter that he still had not been able to divine his own true name.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Saphira curled up on her side of the half circle and went to sleep, leaving Eragon to ruminate by the light of the dying campfire. Glaedr remained awake and aware, and sometimes Eragon consulted with him, but for the most part, he kept to himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The hours crawled past, and Eragon grew increasingly frustrated. His time was running out—ideally he and Saphira should have left for the Varden the previous day—and yet no matter what he tried, he seemed unable to describe himself as he was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was nearly midnight, by his reckoning, when the rain ceased.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon fidgeted, trying to make up his mind; then he bounded to his feet, too wound up to bear sitting any longer. <span class="italic">I’m going for a walk</span>, he said to Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He expected the dragon to object, but instead Glaedr said, <span class="italic">Leave your weapons and armor here</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Whatever you find, you need to face it by yourself. You cannot learn what you are made of if you rely on anyone or anything else to help you</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Glaedr’s words made sense to Eragon, but still he hesitated before he unbuckled his sword and dagger and pulled off his mail hauberk. He donned his boots and his damp cloak, and then he dragged the saddlebags that contained Glaedr’s heart of hearts closer to Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Eragon started to leave the half circle of stones, Glaedr said, <span class="italic">Do what you must, but be careful</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><img alt="figure" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre29"/></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Outside the nesting house, Eragon was pleased to see patches of stars and enough moonlight shining through the gaps in the clouds for him to make out his surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He bounced on the balls of his feet a few times, wondering where to go, and then he set off at a brisk trot toward the heart of the ruined city. After a few seconds, his frustration got the better of him and he increased his pace to an all-out run.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he listened to the sound of his breathing and of his footsteps pounding against the paving stones, he asked himself, <span class="italic">Who am I</span>? But no answer came to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He ran until his lungs began to fail, and then he ran some more, and when neither his lungs nor his legs would sustain him any longer, he stopped by a weed-filled fountain and leaned on his arms against it while he recovered his breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Around him loomed the shapes of several enormous buildings: shadowy hulks that looked like a range of ancient, crumbling mountains. The fountain stood in the center of a vast square courtyard, much of which was littered with pieces of broken stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He pushed himself off the fountain and slowly turned in a circle. In the distance, he could hear the deep, resonant croaking of the bullfrogs, an odd booming sound that grew especially loud whenever one of the larger frogs participated.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A cracked slab of stone several yards away caught his eye. He walked over, grasped it by the edges, and, with a heave, picked it off the ground. The muscles in his arms burning, he staggered to the edge of the courtyard and threw the slab onto the grass beyond.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It landed with a soft but satisfying <span class="italic">thump</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He strode back to the fountain, unclasped his cloak, and draped it over the edge of the sculpture. Then he strode to the next piece of rubble—a jagged wedge that had cleaved off a larger block—and he fit his fingers underneath it and lifted it onto his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For over an hour, he labored to clear the courtyard. Some of the <span>fallen</span> masonry was so big, he had to use magic to move it, but for the most part he was able to use his hands. He was methodical about it; he worked back and forth across the courtyard, and every piece of rubble he encountered, no matter how large or small, he stopped to remove.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The effort soon left him drenched in sweat. He would have removed his tunic, but the edges of the stone were often sharp and would have cut him. As it was, he accumulated a host of bruises across his chest and shoulders, and he scraped his hands in numerous places.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The exertion helped calm his mind and, since it required little thought, left him free to mull over all that he was and all that he might be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the midst of his self-appointed task, as he was resting after having shifted a particularly heavy length of cornice, he heard a threatening <span class="italic">hiss</span>, and he looked up to see a snalglí—this one with a shell at least six feet tall—gliding out of the darkness with startling speed. The creature’s boneless neck was fully extended, its lipless mouth was like a slash of darkness splitting its soft flesh, and its bulbous eyes were pointed directly at him. By the light of the moon, the snalglí’s exposed flesh gleamed like silver, as did the track of slime it left behind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Letta,” said Eragon, and he straightened upright and shook drops of blood from his torn hands. “Ono ach <span class="italic">néiat</span> threyja eom verrunsmal edtha, O snalglí.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he spoke his warning, the snail slowed and retracted its eyes several inches. It paused when it was a few yards away, hissed again, and began to circle around to his left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oh no you don’t,” he muttered, turning with it. He glanced over his shoulders to make sure no other snalglí were approaching from behind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The giant snail seemed to realize that it could not catch him by surprise, for it stopped and sat hissing and waving its eyeballs at him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You sound like a teapot left to boil,” he said to it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The snalglí’s eyeballs waved even faster, and then it charged at him, the edges of its flat belly undulating.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon waited until the last moment, then jumped to the side and let the snalglí slide past. He laughed and slapped the back of its shell. “Not too bright, are you?” Dancing away from it, he began to taunt the creature in the ancient language, calling it all sorts of insulting but perfectly accurate names.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The snail seemed to puff up with rage—its neck thickened and bulged, and it opened its mouth even farther and began to sputter as well as hiss.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again and again, it charged at Eragon, and every time he jumped out of the way. At last the snalglí grew tired of the game. It withdrew a half-dozen yards and sat staring at him with its fist-sized eyeballs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How do you ever catch anything when you’re so slow?” Eragon asked in a mocking tone, and he stuck his tongue out at the snail.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The snalglí hissed once more, and then it turned around and slid off into the darkness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon waited several minutes to be sure it was gone before he returned to clearing the rubble. “Maybe I should just call myself Snail Vanquisher,” he muttered as he rolled a section of a pillar across the courtyard. “Eragon Shadeslayer, Vanquisher of Snails. … I would strike fear into the hearts of men wherever I went.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">It was the deepest part of the night when he finally dropped the last piece of stone onto the border of grass that edged the courtyard. There he stood, panting. He was cold and hungry and tired, and the scrapes on his hands and wrists smarted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He had ended by the northeastern corner of the courtyard. To the north was an immense hall that had been mostly destroyed during the battle; all that remained standing was a portion of the back walls and a single, ivy-covered pillar where the entryway had been.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He stared at the pillar for the longest time. Above it, a cluster of stars—red, blue, and white—shone through an opening in the <span>clouds</span>, gleaming like cut diamonds. He felt a strange attraction to them, as if their appearance signified something that he ought to be aware of.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without bothering to consider his action, he walked to the base of the pillar—scrambling over piles of rubble—then reached as high as he could and grasped the thickest part of the ivy: a stem as big around as his forearm and covered with thousands of tiny hairs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He tugged on the vine. It held, so he jumped off the ground and began to climb. Hand over hand, he scaled the pillar, which must have been three hundred feet tall, but which felt taller the farther he got from the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He knew he was being reckless, but then, he felt reckless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Halfway up, the smaller tendrils of vine began to peel off the stone when he put his full weight on them. After that, he was careful to only grab hold of the main stem and some of the thicker side branches.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His grip had almost given out by the time he arrived at the top. The crown of the pillar was still intact; it formed a square, flat surface large enough to sit on, with over a foot to spare on each side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Feeling somewhat shaky from the exertion, Eragon crossed his legs and rested his hands palm upward on his knees, allowing the air to soothe his torn skin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Below him lay the ruined city: a maze of shattered husks that often echoed with strange, forlorn cries. In a few places where there were ponds, he could see the faint, glowing lights of the bullfrogs’ lures, like lanterns viewed from a great distance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Angler frogs</span>, he thought suddenly in the ancient language. <span class="italic">That’s what their name is: angler frogs</span>. And he knew he was right, for the words seemed to fit like a key in a lock.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he shifted his gaze to the cluster of stars that had inspired his climb. He slowed his breathing and concentrated on maintaining a steady, never-ending flow of air in and out of his lungs. The cold, his hunger, and his trembling exhaustion gave him a peculiar sense of clarity; he seemed to float apart from his body, as if the <span>bond</span> between his consciousness and his flesh had grown attenuated, and there came upon him a heightened awareness of the city and the island around him. He was acutely sensitive to every motion of the wind and to every sound and smell that wafted past the top of the pillar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he sat there, he thought of more names, and though none fully described him, his failures did not upset him, for the clarity he felt was too deep-seated for any setback to perturb his equanimity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">How can I include everything I am in just a few words</span>? he wondered, and he continued to ponder the question as the stars turned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Three warped shadows flew across the city—like small, moving rifts in reality—and landed upon the roof of the building to his left. Then the dark, owl-shaped silhouettes spread their barbed plumes and stared at him with luminous, evil-looking eyes. The shadows chattered softly to one another, and two of them scratched their empty wings with claws that had no depth. The third held the remains of a bullfrog between its ebony talons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He watched the menacing birds for several minutes, and they watched him in return, and then they took flight and ghosted away to the west, making no more noise than a falling feather.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Near dawn, when Eragon could see the morning star between two peaks to the east, he asked himself, “What do I want?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Until then, he had not bothered to consider the question. He wanted to overthrow Galbatorix: that, of course. But should they succeed, what, then? Ever since he had left Palancar Valley, he had thought that he and Saphira would one day return, to live near the mountains he so loved. However, as he pondered the prospect, he slowly realized that it no longer appealed to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He had grown up in Palancar Valley, and he would always consider it home. But what was left there for him or Saphira? Carvahall was destroyed, and even if the villagers rebuilt it someday, the town would never be the same. Besides, most of the friends he and Saphira had made lived elsewhere, and the two of them had obligations to <span>the</span> various races of Alagaësia—obligations that they could not ignore. And after all the things they had done and seen, he could not imagine that either of them would be content to live in such an ordinary, isolated place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">For the sky is hollow and the world is round</span>. …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even if they did return, what would they do? Raise cows and farm wheat? He had no desire to eke out a living from the land as his family had during his childhood. He and Saphira were a Rider and dragon; their doom and their destiny was to fly at the forefront of history, not to sit before a fire and grow fat and lazy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And then there was Arya. If he and Saphira lived in Palancar Valley, he would see her rarely, if at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Eragon, and the word was like a hammerblow in the silence. “I don’t want to go back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A cold tingle crawled down his spine. He had known he had changed since he, Brom, and Saphira had set out to track down the Ra’zac, but he had clung to the belief that, at his core, he was still the same person. Now he understood that this was no longer true. The boy he had been when he first set foot outside of Palancar Valley had ceased to exist; Eragon did not look like him, he did not act like him, and he no longer wanted the same things from life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He took a deep breath and then released it in a long, shuddering sigh as the truth sank into him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I am not who I was.” Saying it aloud seemed to give the thought weight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then, as the first rays of dawn brightened the eastern sky over the ancient island of Vroengard, where the Riders and dragons had once lived, he thought of a name—a name such as he had not thought of before—and as he did, a sense of certainty came over him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He said the name, whispered it to himself in the deepest recesses of his mind, and all his body seemed to vibrate at once, as if Saphira had struck the pillar beneath him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And then he gasped, and he found himself both laughing and crying—laughing that he had succeeded and for the sheer joy of <span>comprehension</span>; crying because all his failings, all the mistakes he had made, were now obvious to him, and he no longer had any delusions to comfort himself with.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I am not who I was,” he whispered, gripping the edges of the column, “but I know who I am.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The name, his true name, was weaker and more flawed than he would have liked, and he hated himself for that, but there was also much to admire within it, and the more he thought about it, the more he was able to accept the true nature of his self. He was not the best person in the world, but neither was he the worst.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And I <span class="italic">won’t</span> give up,” he growled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He took solace in the fact that his identity was not immutable; he could improve himself if he wished. And right then, he swore to himself that he would do better in the future, be it ever so hard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Still laughing, still crying, he turned his face toward the sky and spread his arms out to either side. In time, the tears and the laughter stopped, and in their place he felt a sense of deep calm overlaid with a tinge of happiness and resignation. Despite Glaedr’s admonition, he again whispered his true name, and once more his entire being shook from the force of the words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Keeping his arms outstretched, he stood atop the pillar, and then he tipped forward and fell headfirst toward the ground. Just before he struck, he said, “Vëoht,” and he slowed, rotated, and alit upon the cracked stone as gently as if he were stepping out of a carriage.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He returned to the fountain in the center of the courtyard and retrieved his cloak. Then, as light spread through the ruined city, he hurried back toward the nesting house, eager to wake Saphira and tell her and Glaedr of his discovery.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_118"></div></body>
