<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">THE TEN OF</span></span> them—including Umaroth—continued to talk for another hour. Orrin required more convincing, and there were numerous details to decide: questions of timing and placement and signaling.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was relieved when Arya said, “Unless either you or Saphira object, I will accompany you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We would be glad to have you,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Islanzadí stiffened. “What good would that accomplish? Your talents are needed elsewhere, Arya. Blödhgarm and the other spellcasters I assigned to Saphira and Eragon are more skilled at magic than you and more experienced in battle as well. Remember, they fought against the Forsworn, and unlike many, they lived to tell of it. Many of the elder members of our race would volunteer to take your place. It would be selfish to insist upon going when there are others better suited for the task who are willing and close at hand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I think no one is as suited for the task as Arya,” Eragon said in a calm voice. “And there is no one, other than Saphira, I would rather have by my side.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Islanzadí kept her gaze upon Arya and to Eragon said, “You are still young, Shadeslayer, and you are allowing your emotions to cloud your judgment.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, Mother,” said Arya. “It is you who are allowing your emotions to cloud your judgment.” She moved toward Islanzadí with long, graceful steps. “You are right, there are others who are stronger, wiser, and more experienced than I. But it was I who ferried Saphira’s egg about Alagaësia. I who helped save Eragon from the Shade Durza. And I who, with Eragon’s help, killed the Shade <span>Varaug</span> in Feinster. Like Eragon, I am now a Shadeslayer, and you well know that I swore myself in service to our people long ago. Who else among our kind can claim as much? Even if I wanted to, I would not turn away from this. I would sooner die. I am as prepared for this challenge as any of our elders, for it is to this I have devoted the whole of my life, as has Eragon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And the whole of your life has been so short,” said Islanzadí. She put a hand up to Arya’s face. “You have devoted yourself to fighting Galbatorix all these years since your father’s death, but you know little of the joys life can provide. And in those years, we have spent such a small amount of time together: a handful of days scattered throughout a century. It is only since you brought Saphira and Eragon to Ellesméra that we have begun to speak once more, as a mother and daughter ought. I would not lose you again so soon, Arya.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It was not I who chose to remain apart,” said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Islanzadí, and she took her hand away. “But it was you who chose to leave Du Weldenvarden.” Her expression softened. “I do not wish to argue, Arya. I understand that you see this as your duty, but please, for my sake, will you not allow another to take your place?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya lowered her gaze and was silent for a time. Then she said, “I cannot allow Eragon and Saphira to go without me any more than you can allow your army to march into battle without you at its head. I cannot. … Would you have it said of me that I am a coward? Those of our family do not turn away from what must be done; do not ask me to shame myself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The shine in Islanzadí’s eyes looked suspiciously like tears to Eragon. “Yes,” said the queen, “but to fight Galbatorix …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“If you are so afraid,” said Arya, but not unkindly, “then come with me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I cannot. I must stay to command my troops.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And I must go with Eragon and Saphira. But I promise you, I shall not die.” Arya placed her hand on Islanzadí’s face even as her <span>mother</span> had done to her. “<span class="italic">I shall not die</span>.” Once more Arya repeated the phrase, but this time in the ancient language.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya’s determination impressed Eragon; to say what she had in the ancient language meant that she believed it without qualification. Islanzadí also appeared impressed, and proud too. She smiled and kissed Arya once on each cheek. “Then go, and go with my blessings. And take no more risks than you must.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Nor you.” And the two of them embraced.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they separated, Islanzadí looked at Eragon and Saphira and said, “Watch over her, I implore you, for she has not a dragon or the Eldunarí to protect her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We will</span>, both Eragon and Saphira replied, in the ancient language.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once they had settled what needed to be settled, the war council broke and its various members began to disperse. From where he sat by Saphira, Eragon watched the others mill about. Neither he nor she made an effort to move. Saphira was going to remain hidden behind the hill until the attack, while he intended to wait for dark before he ventured into the camp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik was the second to depart, after Roran. Before he did, the dwarf king came over to Eragon and gave him a rough hug. “Ah, I wish I were going with the two of you,” he said, his eyes solemn above his beard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And I wish you were coming,” said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well, we’ll see each other afterward and toast our victory with barrels of mead, eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I look forward to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">As do I</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Good,” said Orik, and he nodded firmly. “That’s settled, then. You’d better not let Galbatorix get the better of you, or I’ll be honor-bound to march in after you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We’ll be careful,” Eragon said with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I should hope so, because I doubt I could do much more than tweak Galbatorix on the nose.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">That I would like to see</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik grunted. “May the gods watch over you, Eragon, and you as well, Saphira.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And you, Orik, Thrifk’s son.” Then Orik slapped Eragon on the shoulder and stomped off to where he had tied his pony to a bush.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Islanzadí and Blödhgarm left, Arya stayed. She was deep in conversation with Jörmundur, and so Eragon thought little of it. When Jörmundur rode off, however, and Arya still lingered nearby, he realized that she wanted to talk to them alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Sure enough, once everyone else had gone, she looked at him and Saphira and said, “Did something else happen to you while you were gone, something that you didn’t want to speak of in front of Orrin or Jörmundur … or my mother?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why do you ask?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She hesitated. “Because … you both seem to have changed. Is it the Eldunarí, or does it have to do with your experience in the storm?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon smiled at her perception. He consulted with Saphira, and when she approved, he said, “We learned our true names.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya’s eyes widened. “You did? And … were you pleased with them?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">In part</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We learned our true names,” Eragon repeated. “We saw that the earth is round. And during the flight here, Umaroth and the other Eldunarí shared many of their memories with us.” He allowed himself a wry smile. “I can’t say we understand all of them, but they make things seem … different.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I see,” murmured Arya. “Do you think the change is for the better?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I do. Change itself is neither good nor bad, but knowledge is always useful.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Was it difficult to find your true names?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So he told her how they had accomplished it, and he also told her about the strange creatures they had encountered on Vroengard Island, which interested her greatly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Eragon spoke, an idea occurred to him, one that resonated within him too strongly to ignore. He explained it to Saphira, and once again she granted him her permission, although somewhat more reluctantly than before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Must you</span>? she asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then do as you will, but only if she agrees</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When they finished speaking of Vroengard, he looked Arya in the eyes and said, “Would you like to hear my true name? I would like to share it with you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The offer seemed to shock her. “No! You shouldn’t tell it to me or anyone else. Especially not when we’re so close to Galbatorix. He might steal it from my mind. Besides, you should only give your true name to … to one whom you trust above all others.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I trust you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eragon, even when we elves exchange our true names, we do not do so until we have known each other for many, many years. The knowledge they provide is too personal, too intimate, to bandy about, and there is no greater risk than sharing it. When you teach someone your true name, you place everything you are in their hands.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know, but I may never have the chance again. This is the only thing I have to give, and I would give it to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eragon, what you are proposing … It is the most precious thing one person can give another.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A shiver ran through Arya, and then she seemed to withdraw within herself. After a time, she said, “No one has ever offered me such a gift before. … I’m honored by your trust, Eragon, and I understand how much this means to you, but no, I must decline. It would be wrong for you to do this and wrong for me to accept just because tomorrow we may be killed or enslaved. Danger is no reason to act foolishly, no matter how great our peril.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon inclined his head. Her reasons were good reasons, and he would respect her choice. “Very well, as you wish,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Thank you, Eragon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A moment passed. Then he said, “Have you ever told anyone your true name?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not even your mother?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her mouth twisted. “No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you know what it is?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Of course. Why would you think otherwise?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He half shrugged. “I didn’t. I just wasn’t sure.” Silence came between them. Then, “When … how did you learn your true name?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya was quiet for so long, he began to think that she would refuse to answer. Then she took a breath and said, “It was a number of years after I left Du Weldenvarden, when I finally had become accustomed to my role among the Varden and the dwarves. Faolin and my other companions were away, and I had a great deal of time to myself. I spent most of it exploring Tronjheim, wandering in the empty reaches of the city-mountain, where others rarely tread. Tronjheim is bigger than most realize, and there are many strange things within it: rooms, people, creatures, forgotten artifacts. … As I wandered, I thought, and I came to know myself better than ever I had before. One day I discovered a room somewhere high in Tronjheim—I doubt I could locate it again, even if I tried. A beam of sunlight seemed to pour into the room, though the ceiling was solid, and in the center of the room was a pedestal, and upon the pedestal was growing a single flower. I do not know what kind of flower it was; I have never seen its like before or since. The petals were purple, but the center of the blossom was like a drop of blood. There were thorns upon the stem, and the flower exuded the most wonderful scent and seemed to hum with a music all its own. It was such an amazing and unlikely thing to find, I stayed in the room, staring at the flower for longer than I can remember, and it was then and there that I was finally able to put words to who I was and who I am.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would like to see that flower someday.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Perhaps you will.” Arya glanced toward the Varden’s camp. “I should go. There is much yet to be done.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He nodded. “We’ll see you tomorrow, then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Tomorrow.” Arya began to walk away. After a few steps, she paused and looked back. “I’m glad that Saphira chose you as her Rider, Eragon. And I’m proud to have fought alongside you. You have become more than any of us dared hope. Whatever happens tomorrow, know that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then she resumed her stride, and soon she disappeared around the curve of the hill, leaving him alone with Saphira and the Eldunarí.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_134"></div></body>
