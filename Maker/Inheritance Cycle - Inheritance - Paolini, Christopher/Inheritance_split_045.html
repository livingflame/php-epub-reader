<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">OVER A QUARTER</span></span> of an hour passed before the flap to Eragon’s tent stirred and Solembum pushed his way inside, his padded feet nearly silent upon the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The tawny werecat walked past Eragon without looking at him, jumped onto his cot, and settled among his blankets, whereupon he began to lick the webbing between the claws of his right paw. Still not looking at Eragon, he said, <span class="italic">I am not a dog to come and go at your summons, Eragon</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I never thought you were,” Eragon replied. “But I have need of you, and it is urgent.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Mmh</span>. The rasping of Solembum’s tongue grew louder as he concentrated on the leathery palm of his foot. <span class="italic">Speak then, Shadeslayer. What do you want</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“One moment.” Eragon stood and went over to the pole where his lantern hung. “I’m going to light this,” he warned Solembum. Then Eragon spoke a word in the ancient language, and a flame sprang to life atop the wick of the lantern, filling the tent with a warm, flickering illumination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Both Eragon and Solembum squinted while they waited for their eyes to adjust to the increase in brightness. When the light no longer felt quite so uncomfortable, Eragon seated himself on his stool, not far from the cot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The werecat, he was puzzled to see, was watching him with ice-blue eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Weren’t your eyes a different color?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum blinked once, and his eyes changed from blue to gold. Then he resumed cleaning his paw. <span class="italic">What do you want, Shadeslayer? <span>The</span> night is for the doing of things, not sitting and talking</span>. The tip of his tasseled tail lashed from side to side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon wet his lips, his hope making him nervous. “Solembum, you told me that when all seemed lost and my power was insufficient, I should go to the Rock of Kuthian and open the Vault of Souls.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The werecat paused in his licking. <span class="italic">Ah, that</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes, that. And I need to know what you meant by it. If there’s anything that can help us against Galbatorix, I need to know about it now—not later, not once I manage to solve one riddle or another, but <span class="italic">now</span>. So, where can I find the Rock of Kuthian, how do I open the Vault of Souls, and what will I find inside it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum’s black-tipped ears angled backward slightly, and the claws on the paw he was cleaning extended halfway from their sheaths. <span class="italic">I don’t know</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You don’t know?!” exclaimed Eragon in disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Must you repeat everything I say</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How can you not know?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I don’t know</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Leaning forward, Eragon grabbed Solembum’s large, heavy paw. The werecat’s ears flattened, and he hissed and curled his paw inward, digging his claws into Eragon’s hand. Eragon smiled tightly and ignored the pain. The werecat was stronger than he had expected, almost strong enough to pull him off the stool.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No more riddles,” Eragon said. “I need the truth, Solembum. Where did you get this information and what does it mean?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The fur along Solembum’s spine bristled. <span class="italic">Sometimes riddles are the truth, you thick-headed human. Now let me go, or I’ll tear your face off and feed your guts to the crows</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon maintained his grip for a moment longer, then he released Solembum’s paw and leaned back. He clenched his hand to help dull the pain and stop the bleeding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum glared at him with slitted eyes, all pretense of detachment gone. <span class="italic">I said I don’t know because, despite what you might think, <span>I</span> do not know. I have no knowledge of where the Rock of Kuthian might lie, nor how you might open the Vault of Souls, nor what the vault might contain</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Say that in the ancient language.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum’s eyes narrowed even farther, but he repeated himself in the tongue of the elves, and then Eragon knew he was speaking the truth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So many questions occurred to Eragon, he hardly knew which to ask first. “How did you learn of the Rock of Kuthian, then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again Solembum’s tail lashed from side to side, flattening wrinkles in the blanket. <span class="italic">For the last time, I do not know. Nor do any of my kind</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then how …?” Eragon trailed off, overcome by confusion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Soon after the fall of the Riders, a certain conviction came upon the members of our race that, should we encounter a new Rider, one who was not beholden to Galbatorix, we should tell him or her what I told you: of the Menoa tree and of the Rock of Kuthian</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But … where did the information come from?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum’s muzzle wrinkled as he bared his teeth in an unpleasant smile. <span class="italic">That we cannot say, only that whoever or whatever was responsible for it meant well</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How can you know that?” exclaimed Eragon. “What if it was Galbatorix? He could be trying to trick you. He could be trying to trick Saphira and me, so as to capture us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No</span>, said Solembum, and his claws sank into the blanket under him. <span class="italic">Werecats are not so easily fooled as others. Galbatorix is not the one behind this. Of that, I am sure. Whoever wanted you to have this information is the same person or creature who arranged for you to find the brightsteel for your sword. Would Galbatorix have done that</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon frowned. “Haven’t you tried to find out who is behind this?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We have</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We failed</span>. The werecat ruffled his fur. <span class="italic">There are two possibilities. <span>One</span>, that our memories were altered against our will and we are the pawns of some nefarious entity. Or two, that we agreed to the alteration, for whatever reason. Perhaps we even excised the memories ourselves. I find it difficult and distasteful to believe that anyone could have succeeded in meddling with our minds. A few of us, I could understand. But our entire race? No. It cannot be</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why would you, the werecats, have been entrusted with this information</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Because, I would guess, we have always been friends of the Riders and friends of the dragons. … We are the watchers. The listeners. The wanderers. We walk alone in the dark places of the world, and we remember what is and what has been</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum’s gaze shifted away. <span class="italic">Understand this, Eragon. None of us have been happy with the situation. We long debated whether it would cause more harm than good to pass on this information should the moment arise. In the end, the decision was mine, and I decided to tell you, for it seemed you needed all the help you could get. Make of it what you will</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But what am I supposed to do?” said Eragon. “How am I supposed to find the Rock of Kuthian?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">That I cannot say</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then what use is the information? I might as well have never heard it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum blinked, once. <span class="italic">There is one other thing I can tell you. It may mean nothing, but perhaps it can show you the way</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What? What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If you but wait, I will tell you. When I first met you in Teirm, I had a strange feeling that you ought to have the book</span> Domia abr Wyrda. <span class="italic">It took me time to arrange it, but it was I who was responsible for Jeod giving the book to you</span>. Then the werecat lifted his other paw and, after a cursory examination, began to lick it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Have you gotten any <span class="italic">other</span> strange feelings in the past few months?” asked Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Only the urge to eat a small red mushroom, but it passed quickly enough</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon grunted and bent down to retrieve the book from under <span>his</span> cot, where he kept it with the rest of his writing supplies. He stared at the large, leather-bound volume before opening it to a random page. As usual, the thicket of runes within made little sense to him at first glance. It was only with a concerted effort that he was able to decipher even a few of them:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">… which, if Taladorous is to be believed, would mean that the mountains themselves were the result of a spell. That, of course, is absurd, for</span> …</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon growled with frustration and closed the book. “I don’t have time for this. It’s too big, and I’m too slow of a reader. I’ve already gone through a fair number of chapters, and I’ve seen nothing having to do with the Rock of Kuthian or the Vault of Souls.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum eyed him for a moment. <span class="italic">You could ask someone else to read it for you, but if there is a secret hidden in</span> Domia abr Wyrda, <span class="italic">you may be the only one who can see it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon resisted the desire to curse. Springing up from the stool, he began to pace again. “Why didn’t you tell me about all this sooner?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It didn’t seem important. Either my advice concerning the vault and the rock would be of help or it wouldn’t, and knowing the origins of that information—or lack thereof—would … have … changed … nothing!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But if I had known it had something to do with the Vault of Souls, I would have spent more time reading it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">But we don’t know that it does</span>, said Solembum. His tongue slipped out of his mouth and passed over the whiskers on each side of his face, smoothing them. <span class="italic">The book may have nothing to do with the Rock of Kuthian or the Vault of Souls. Who can say? Besides, you were already reading it. Would you really have spent more time with it if I had said that I had a feeling—and mind you, nothing more—that the book was of some significance to you? Hmm</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Maybe not … but you still should have told me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The werecat tucked his front paws under his breast and did not answer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon scowled, gripping the book and feeling as if he wanted to tear it apart. “This can’t be everything. There has to be some other piece of information that you’ve forgotten.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Many, but none, I think, related to this</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“In all your travels around Alagaësia, with Angela and without, you’ve never found anything that might explain this mystery? Or even just something that might be of use against Galbatorix.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I found you, didn’t I</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That’s not funny,” growled Eragon. “Blast it, you have to know something more.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I do not</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Think, then! If I can’t find some sort of help against Galbatorix, we’ll lose, Solembum. We’ll lose, and most of the Varden, including the werecats, will die.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum hissed again. <span class="italic">What do you expect of me, Eragon? I cannot invent help where none exists. Read the book</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We’ll be at Urû’baen before I can finish it. The book might as well not exist.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum’s ears flattened again. <span class="italic">That is not my fault</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t care if it is. I just want a way to keep us from ending up dead or enslaved. Think! You have to know something else!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum uttered a low, warbling growl. <span class="italic">I do not. And</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You have to, or we’re doomed!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even as Eragon uttered the words, he saw a change come over the werecat. Solembum’s ears swiveled until they were upright, his whiskers relaxed, and his gaze softened, losing its hard-edged brilliance. At the same time, the werecat’s mind grew unusually empty, as if his consciousness had been stilled or removed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon froze, uncertain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he felt Solembum say, with thoughts that were as flat and colorless as a pool of water beneath a wintry, cloud-ridden <span>sky</span>: <span class="italic">Chapter forty-seven. Page three. Start with the second passage thereon</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum’s gaze sharpened, and his ears returned to their previous position. <span class="italic">What</span>? he said with obvious irritation. <span class="italic">Why are you gaping at me like that</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What did you just say?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I said that I do not know anything else. And that</span>—</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, no, the other thing, about the chapter and page.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Do not toy with me. I said no such thing</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You did.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum studied him for several seconds. Then, with thoughts that were overly calm, he said, <span class="italic">Tell me exactly what you heard, Dragon Rider</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So, Eragon repeated the words as closely as he could. When he finished, the werecat was silent for a while. <span class="italic">I have no memory of that</span>, he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What do you think it means?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It means that we should look and see what’s on page three of chapter forty-seven</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hesitated, then nodded and began to flip through the pages. As he did, he remembered the chapter in question; it was the one devoted to the aftermath of the Riders’ secession from the elves, following the elves’ brief war with the humans. Eragon had read the beginning of the section, but it had seemed to be nothing more than a dry discussion of treaties and negotiations, so he had left it for another time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Soon enough, he arrived at the proper page. Tracing the lines of runes with the tip of his finger, Eragon slowly read out loud:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5">… <span class="italic">The island is remarkably temperate compared with areas of the mainland at the same latitude. Summers are often cool and rainy, but then the winters are mild and tend not to assume the brutal cold of the northern reaches of the Spine, which means that crops could be grown for a goodly portion of the year. By all <span>accounts</span>, the soil is rich and fertile—the one benefit of the fire mountains that are known to erupt from time to time and cover the island with a thick layer of ash—and the forests were full of large game such as the dragons preferred to hunt, including many species not found elsewhere in Alagaësia</span>.</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Eragon paused. “None of this seems relevant.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Keep reading</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Frowning, Eragon continued on to the next paragraph:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It was there, in the great cauldron at the center of Vroengard, that the Riders built their far-famed city, Doru Araeba</span>.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre31"><p class="calibre32"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Doru Araeba! The only city in history designed to house dragons as well as elves and humans. Doru Araeba! A place of magic and learning and ancient mysteries. Doru Araeba! The very name seems to hum with excitement. Never was there a city like it before, and never shall there be again, for now it is lost, destroyed—ground to dust by the usurper Galbatorix</span>.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre31"><p class="calibre32"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The buildings were constructed in the elvish style—with some influence from human Riders in later years—but out of stone, not wood; wooden buildings, as must be obvious to the reader, fare poorly around creatures with razor-sharp claws and the ability to breathe fire. The most notable feature of Doru Araeba, however, was its enormous scale. Every street was wide enough for at least two dragons to walk abreast, and with few exceptions, rooms and doorways were large enough to accommodate dragons of most any size</span>.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre31"><p class="calibre32"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">As a result, Doru Araeba was a vast, sprawling affair, dotted with buildings of such immense proportions, even a dwarf would have been impressed. Gardens and fountains were common throughout the city, on account of the elves’ irrepressible love of nature, and there were many soaring towers among the Riders’ halls and holds</span>.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre31"><p class="calibre32"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Upon the peaks surrounding the city, the Riders placed <span>watchtowers</span> and eyries—to guard against attack—and more than one dragon and Rider had a well-appointed cave high in the mountains, where they lived apart from the rest of their order. The older, larger dragons were especially partial to this arrangement, as they often preferred solitude, and living above the floor of the cauldron made it easier for them to take flight</span>.</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Frustrated, Eragon broke off. The description of Doru Araeba was interesting enough, but he had read other, more detailed accounts of the Riders’ city during his time in Ellesméra. Nor did he enjoy having to decipher the cramped runes, a painstaking process even at the best of times.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This is pointless,” he said, lowering the book.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum looked as annoyed as Eragon felt. <span class="italic">Don’t give up yet. Read another two pages. If there’s nothing by then, then you can stop</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon took a breath and agreed. He ran his finger down the page until he found his place, whereupon he began to again pick out the sounds of the words:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The city contained many marvels, from the Singing Fountain of Eldimírim to the crystal fortress of Svellhjall to the rookeries of the dragons themselves, but for all their splendor, I believe that Doru Araeba’s greatest treasure was its library. Not, as one might assume, because of its imposing structure—although it was indeed imposing—but because over the centuries the Riders collected one of the most comprehensive stores of knowledge in the whole of the land. By the time of the Riders’ fall, there were only three libraries that rivaled it—that of Ilirea, that of Ellesméra, and that of Tronjheim—and none of those three contained as much information about the workings of magic as did the one in Doru Araeba</span>.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="calibre31"><p class="calibre32"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The library was located on the northwestern edge of the city, near the gardens that surrounded Moraeta’s Spire, also known as the Rock of Kuthian</span> …</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s voice died in his throat as he stared at the name. After a moment, he began again, even slower:</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<blockquote class="calibre30"><p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">… also known as the Rock of Kuthian (see chapter twelve), and not far from the high seat, where the leaders of the Riders held court when various kings and queens came to petition them</span>.</span></p></blockquote><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A sense of awe and fear came over Eragon. Some person or some thing had arranged for him to learn this particular piece of information, the same person or thing that had made it possible for him to find the brightsteel for his sword. The thought was intimidating, and now that Eragon knew where to go, he was no longer quite so sure that he wanted to.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">What, he wondered, lay waiting for them on Vroengard? He was afraid to speculate, lest he raise hopes that were impossible to fulfill.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_89"></div></body>
