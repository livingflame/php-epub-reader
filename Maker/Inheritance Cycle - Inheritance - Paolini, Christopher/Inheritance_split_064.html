<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">THE SUN WAS</span></span> still near its zenith when the Varden arrived at Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran heard the cries from the men at the head of his column as they crested a ridge. Curious, he looked up from the heels of the dwarf in front of him, and when he arrived at the top of the ridge, he paused to take in the view, as had each of the warriors before him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The land sloped gently downward for several miles, flattening out into a broad plain dotted with farms, mills, and grand stone estates that reminded him of the ones near Aroughs. Some five miles away, the plain arrived at the outer walls of Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Unlike those of Dras-Leona, the walls of the capital were long enough to encompass the whole of the city. They were taller, too; even from a distance, Roran could see that they dwarfed those of both Dras-Leona and Aroughs. He guessed that they stood at least three hundred feet tall. Upon the wide battlements, he spotted ballistae and catapults mounted at regular intervals.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sight worried him. The machines would be difficult to take down—no doubt they were protected from magical attacks—and he knew from experience just how deadly such weapons could be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind the walls was an odd mixture of human-built structures and those he guessed the elves had made. The most prominent of the elven buildings were six tall, graceful towers—made of a malachite-green stone—which were scattered in an arc throughout what he assumed was the oldest part of the city. Two of the towers were missing their roofs, and he thought he saw the stumps of two more partially buried among the jumble of houses below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">What interested him most, however, was not the wall or the buildings, but the fact that much of the city lay shadowed underneath a huge stone shelf, which must have been over half a mile wide and five hundred feet thick at its narrowest. The overhang formed one end of a massive, sloping hill that stretched off to the northeast for several miles. Atop the craggy lip of the shelf stood another wall, like that which surrounded the city, and several thick watchtowers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the back of the cavelike recess underneath the shelf was an enormous citadel adorned with a profusion of towers and parapets. The citadel rose high above the rest of the city, high enough that it almost scraped the underside of the shelf. Most intimidating of all was the gate set within the front of the fortress: a great, gaping cavern that looked large enough for Saphira and Thorn to walk through side by side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran’s gut tightened. If the gate was any indication, Shruikan was big enough to wipe out their whole army by himself. <span class="italic">Eragon and Saphira had better hurry up</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">And the elves too</span>. From what he had seen, the elves might be able to hold their own against the king’s black dragon, but even they would be hard-pressed to kill him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">All that and more Roran took in as he paused on the ridge. Then he tugged on Snowfire’s reins. Behind him, the white stallion snorted and followed as Roran resumed his weary march, following the winding road as it descended to the lowlands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He could have ridden—was supposed to ride, actually, as captain of his battalion—but after his trip to Aroughs and back, he had come to loathe sitting in a saddle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he walked, he tried to figure out how best to attack the city. The pocket of stone Urû’baen sat nestled within would prevent assaults from the sides and the rear and would interfere with attacks from above, which was surely why the elves had chosen to settle in that location to begin with.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If we could somehow break off the overhang, we could crush the citadel and most of the city</span>, he thought, but he deemed that unlikely, as the <span>stone</span> was too thick. <span class="italic">Still, we might be able to take the wall at the top of the hill. Then we could drop stones and pour boiling oil onto those below. It wouldn’t be easy, though. Uphill fighting, and those walls … Maybe the elves could manage it. Or the Kull. They might enjoy it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The Ramr River was several miles north of Urû’baen, too far to be of any help. Saphira could dig a ditch large enough to divert it, but even she would need weeks to complete such a project, and the Varden did not have weeks’ worth of food. They had only a few days left. After that, they would have to starve or disband.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Their only option was to attack before the Empire did. Not that Roran believed Galbatorix <span class="italic">would</span> attack. So far the king had seemed content to allow the Varden to come to him. <span class="italic">Why should he risk his neck? The longer he waits, the weaker we grow</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Which meant a frontal assault—a brazen fool’s charge over open ground toward walls too thick to breach and too tall to climb while archers and war machines shot at them the whole time. Just imagining it made a sweat break out on his brow. They would die in droves. He cursed. <span class="italic">We’ll dash ourselves to pieces, and all the while Galbatorix will sit laughing in his throne room. … If we can get close to the walls, the soldiers won’t be able to hit us with their foul contraptions, but then we’ll be vulnerable to pitch and oil and rocks being dropped on our heads</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even if they managed to breach the walls, they would still have the whole of Galbatorix’s army to overcome. More important than the defenses of the city, then, would be the character and quality of the men the Varden would face. Would they fight to their last breath? Could they be frightened? Would they break and flee if pushed hard enough? What manner of oaths and spells bound them?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The Varden’s spies had reported that Galbatorix had placed an earl by the name of Lord Barst in command of the troops within Urû’baen. Roran had never heard of Barst before, but the information seemed to dismay Jörmundur, and the men in Roran’s battalion had shared enough stories to persuade him of Barst’s villainy. Supposedly, Barst had been lord of a rather large estate near Gil’ead, which the invasion of the elves had forced him to abandon. His <span>vassals</span> had lived in mortal fear of him, for Barst had a tendency to resolve disputes and punish criminals in the harshest manner possible, often choosing to simply execute those he believed were in the wrong. Of itself, that was hardly notable; many a lord throughout the Empire had a reputation for brutality. Barst, however, was not only ruthless but strong—impressively strong—and cunning to boot. In everything Roran had heard about Barst, the man’s intelligence had been clear. Barst might be a bastard, but he was a smart bastard, and Roran knew it would be a mistake to underestimate him. Galbatorix would not have chosen a weakling or a dullard to command his men.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And then there were Thorn and Murtagh. Galbatorix might not stir from his stronghold, but the red dragon and his Rider were sure to defend the city. <span class="italic">Eragon and Saphira will have to lure them away. Otherwise, we’ll never make it over the walls</span>. Roran frowned. That would be a problem. Murtagh was stronger than Eragon now. Eragon would need the help of the elves to kill him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once again, Roran felt bitter anger and resentment welling up inside him. He hated that he was at the mercy of those who could use magic. At least when it came to strength and cunning, a man might make up for a lack of one with a surfeit of the other. But there was no making up for the absence of magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Frustrated, he scooped up a pebble from the ground and, as Eragon had taught him, said, “Stenr rïsa.” The pebble remained motionless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The pebble <span class="italic">always</span> remained motionless.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He snorted and tossed it by the side of the road.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His wife and unborn child were with the Varden, and yet there was nothing he could do to kill either Murtagh or Galbatorix. He clenched his fists and imagined breaking things. Bones, mostly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Maybe we should flee</span>. It was the first time the thought had occurred to him. He knew there were lands to the east beyond Galbatorix’s reach—fertile plains where none but nomads lived. If the other villagers came with him and Katrina, they could start anew, free of the Empire and Galbatorix. The idea made him sick to consider, <span>however</span>. He would be abandoning Eragon, his men, and the land that he called home. <span class="italic">No. I won’t allow our child to be born into a world where Galbatorix still holds sway. Better to die than to live in fear</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Of course, that still did not solve the problem of how to capture Urû’baen. Always before, there had been a weakness he could exploit. In Carvahall, it had been the Ra’zac’s failure to understand that the villagers would fight. When he wrestled the Urgal Yarbog, it had been the creature’s horns. In Aroughs, it had been the canals. But here at Urû’baen, he saw no weaknesses, no place where he could turn his opponents’ strength against them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If we had the supplies, I would wait and starve them out. That would be the best way. Anything else is madness</span>. But as he knew, war was a catalog of madness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Magic is the only way</span>, he finally concluded. <span class="italic">Magic and Saphira. If we can kill Murtagh, then either she or the elves will have to help us past the walls</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He scowled, a sour taste in his mouth, and quickened his stride. The faster they made camp, the better. His feet were sore from walking, and if he was going to die in a senseless charge, then at least he wanted a hot meal and a good night’s sleep beforehand.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">The Varden set up their tents a mile from Urû’baen, by a small stream that fed the Ramr River. Then the men, dwarves, and Urgals began constructing defenses, a process that would continue until night and then resume in the morning. In fact, as long as they stayed in one location, they would continue to work on reinforcing their perimeter. The warriors detested the labor, but it kept them busy and, moreover, it might save their lives.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Everyone thought the orders came from the shadow-Eragon. Roran knew they actually came from Jörmundur. He had come to respect the older warrior since Nasuada’s abduction and Eragon’s departure. Jörmundur had been fighting the Empire nearly his whole life, and he had a deep understanding of tactics and logistics. He and Roran got along well; they were both men of steel, not magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And then there was King Orrin, with whom—after the initial defenses had been established—Roran found himself arguing. Orrin never failed to irritate him; if anyone was going to get them killed, it was him. Roran knew that offending a king was not the healthiest thing to do, but the fool wanted to send a messenger to the front gates of Urû’baen and issue a formal challenge, the way they had at Dras-Leona and Belatona.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you <span class="italic">want</span> to provoke Galbatorix?” Roran growled. “If we do that, he might respond!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well, of course,” said King Orrin, drawing himself upright. “It’s only proper that we announce our intentions and provide him with the opportunity to parley for peace.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran stared; then he turned away in disgust and said to Jörmundur, “Can’t you make him see reason?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The three of them were gathered in Orrin’s pavilion, where the king had summoned them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Your Majesty,” said Jörmundur, “Roran is right. It would be best to wait to contact the Empire.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But they can see us,” protested Orrin. “We’re camped right outside their walls. It would be … <span class="italic">rude</span> not to send an envoy to state our position. You are both commoners; I would not expect you to understand. Royalty demands certain courtesies, even if we are at war.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">An urge to strike the king swept through Roran. “Are you so puffed up as to believe Galbatorix considers you an equal? Bah! We’re insects to him. He cares nothing for your courtesy. You forget, Galbatorix was a commoner like us before he overthrew the Riders. His ways are not your ways. There is no one like him in the world, and you think to predict him? You think to placate him? Bah!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orrin’s face colored, and he threw aside his goblet of wine, dashing it against the rug upon the ground. “You go too far, Stronghammer. No man has the right to insult me like that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I have the right to do whatever I want,” growled Roran. “I’m not one of your subjects. I don’t answer to you. I’m a free man, and <span>I</span>’ll insult anyone I choose, whenever I choose, however I choose—even you. It would be a mistake to send that messenger, and I—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There was a screech of sliding steel as King Orrin tore his sword from its scabbard. He did not catch Roran entirely unawares; Roran already had his hand on his hammer, and as he heard the sound, he yanked the weapon from his belt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king’s blade was a silver blur in the dim light of the tent. Roran saw where Orrin was going to strike and stepped out of the way. Then he rapped the flat of the king’s sword, causing it to flex and ring and leap out of Orrin’s hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The jeweled weapon fell onto the rug, the blade quivering.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sire,” cried one of the guards outside. “Are you all right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I just dropped my shield,” replied Jörmundur. “There’s no need for concern.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sir, yes sir.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran stared at the king; there was a wild, hunted look on Orrin’s face. Without taking his eyes off him, Roran returned his hammer to his belt. “Contacting Galbatorix is stupid and dangerous. If you try, I’ll kill whomever you send before he reaches the city.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You wouldn’t dare!” said Orrin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I would, and I will. I won’t let you endanger the rest of us just to satisfy your royal … <span class="italic">pride</span>. If Galbatorix wants to talk, then he knows where to find us. Otherwise, <span class="italic">let him be</span>.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran stormed out of the pavilion. Outside, he stood with his hands on his hips and gazed at the puffy clouds while he waited for his pulse to subside. Orrin was like a yearling mule: stubborn, overconfident, and all too willing to kick you in the gut if you gave him the opportunity.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And he drinks too much</span>, thought Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He paced in front of the pavilion until Jörmundur emerged. Before the other man could speak, Roran said, “I’m sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“As well you should be.” Jörmundur drew a hand over his face, then removed a clay pipe from the purse on his belt and began to fill it with cardus weed, which he tamped down with the ball of his <span>thumb</span>. “It took me this whole time to convince him not to send an envoy just to spite you.” He paused for a moment. “Would you really kill one of Orrin’s men?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t make idle threats,” said Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, I didn’t think so. … Well, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.” Jörmundur started down the path between the tents, and Roran followed. As they walked, men moved out of their way and respectfully dipped their heads. Gesturing with his unlit pipe, Jörmundur said, “I admit, I’ve wanted to give Orrin a good tongue-lashing on more than one occasion.” His lips stretched in a thin smile. “Unfortunately, discretion has always gotten the better of me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Has he always been so … intractable?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Hmm? No, no. In Surda, he was far more reasonable.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What happened, then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Fear, I think. It does strange things to men.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It may offend you to hear this, but you acted rather stupidly yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know. My temper got the better of me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And you’ve earned yourself a king as a foe.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You mean <span class="italic">another</span> king.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Jörmundur uttered a low laugh. “Yes, well, I suppose when you have Galbatorix as a personal enemy, all others seem rather harmless. Nevertheless …” He stopped by a campfire and pulled a thin burning branch from the midst of the flames. Tipping the end of the branch into the bowl of his pipe, he puffed several times, setting the flame, then threw the branch back into the fire. “Nevertheless, I wouldn’t ignore Orrin’s anger. He was willing to kill you back there. If he holds a grudge, and I think he will, he may seek his revenge. I’ll post a guard by your tent for the next few days. After that, though …” Jörmundur shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“After that, we may all be dead or enslaved.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They walked in silence for a few more minutes, Jörmundur puffing <span>on</span> his pipe the whole while. As they were about to part, Roran said, “When you see Orrin next …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Perhaps you can let him know that if he or his men hurt Katrina, I’ll rip out his guts in front of the whole camp.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Jörmundur tucked his chin against his breast and stood thinking for a moment, then he looked up and nodded. “I think I might find a way to do that, Stronghammer.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“My thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’re most welcome. As always, this was a unique pleasure.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Sir.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Roran sought out Katrina and convinced her to bring their dinner to the northern embankment, where he kept vigil for any messengers Orrin might send. They ate on a cloth that Katrina spread over the freshly turned soil, then sat together as the shadows grew long and the stars began to appear in the purple sky above the overhang.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m glad to be here,” she said, leaning her head against his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Are you? Really?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s beautiful, and I have you all to myself.” She squeezed his arm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He drew her closer, but the shadow in his heart remained. He could not forget the danger that threatened her and their child. The knowledge that their greatest foe was but a few miles distant burned within him; he wanted nothing more than to leap up, run to Urû’baen, and kill Galbatorix.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">But that was impossible, so he smiled and laughed and hid his fear, even as he knew she hid hers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Blast it, Eragon</span>, he thought, <span class="italic">you’d better hurry, or I swear I’ll haunt you from the grave</span>.</span></p>
