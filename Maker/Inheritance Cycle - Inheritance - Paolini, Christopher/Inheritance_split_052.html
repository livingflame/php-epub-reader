<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">AS NASUADA LAY</span></span> on the slab, sweating and shivering, every part of her body aching with pain, she found herself wishing that Murtagh would return, if only so he could again free her from her agony.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When at last the door to the eight-sided chamber swung open, she was unable to suppress her relief, but her relief turned to bitter disappointment when she heard the shuffling footsteps of her jailer descending the stairs that led into the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he had once before, the stocky, narrow-shouldered man bathed her wounds with a wet cloth, then bound them with strips of linen. When he released her from the restraints so that she could visit the privy room, she found she was too weak to make any attempt to grab the knife on the tray of food. Instead, she contented herself with thanking the man for his help and, for the second time, complimenting him on his nails, which were even shinier than before and which he quite obviously wanted her to see, for he kept holding his hands where she could not help but look at them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After he fed her and departed, she tried to sleep, but the constant pain of her wounds made it impossible for her to do more than doze.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Her eyes snapped open as she heard the bar to the door of the chamber being thrown open.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Not again!</span> she thought, panic welling up inside her. <span class="italic">Not so soon! I can’t bear it. … I’m not strong enough</span>. Then she reined in her fear and told herself, <span class="italic">Don’t. Don’t say such things or else you’ll start to believe them</span>. Still, although she was able to master her conscious <span>reactions</span>, she could not stop her heart from pounding at twice its normal speed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A single pair of footsteps echoed in the room, and then Murtagh appeared at the corner of her vision. He wore no mask, and his expression was somber.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">This time he healed her first, without waiting. The relief she felt as her pain abated was so intense, it bordered on ecstasy. In all her life, she had never experienced a sensation quite so pleasurable as the draining away of the agony.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She gasped slightly at the feeling. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh nodded; then he went over to the wall and sat in the same spot as before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She studied him for a minute. The skin on his knuckles was smooth and whole again, and he appeared sober, if grim and close-mouthed. His clothes had once been fine, but they were now torn, frayed, and patched, and she spotted what looked like several cuts in the undersides of his sleeves. She wondered if he had been fighting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Does Galbatorix know where you are?” she finally asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He might, but I doubt it. He’s busy playing with his favorite concubines. That, or he’s asleep. It’s the middle of the night right now. Besides, I cast a spell to keep anyone from listening to us. He could break it if he wants, but I would know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What if he finds out?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh shrugged.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He will find out, you know, if he wears down my defenses.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then don’t let him. You’re stronger than me; you have no one he can threaten. You can resist him, unlike me. … The Varden are fast approaching, as are the elves from the north. If you can hold out for another few days, there’s a chance … there’s a chance maybe they can free you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You don’t believe they can, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He shrugged again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“… Then help me escape.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A bark of hard laughter erupted from his throat. “How? I can’t do much more than put on my boots without Galbatorix’s permission.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You could loosen my cuffs, and when you leave, perhaps you could forget to secure the door.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His upper lip curled in a sneer. “There are two men stationed outside, there are wards set upon this room to warn Galbatorix if a prisoner steps outside it, and there are hundreds of guards between here and the nearest gate. You’d be lucky to make it to the end of the hallway, if that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Perhaps, but I’d like to try.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’d only get yourself killed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then help me. If you wanted, you could find a way to fool his wards.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I can’t. My oaths won’t let me use magic against him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What of the guards, though? If you held them off long enough for me to reach the gate, I could hide myself in the city, and it wouldn’t matter if Galbatorix knew—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The city is his. Besides, wherever you went, he could find you with a spell. The only way you would be safe from him would be to get far away from here before the alarm roused him, and that you could not do even on dragonback.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There must be a way!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“If there were …” He smiled sourly and looked down. “It’s pointless to consider.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Frustrated, she shifted her gaze to the ceiling for a few moments. Then, “At least let me out of these cuffs.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He released his breath in a sound of exasperation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Just so I can stand up,” she said. “I hate lying on this stone, and it’s making my eyes ache having to look at you down there.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He hesitated, and then he rose to his feet in a single graceful movement, came over to the slab, and began to unfasten the padded restraints around her wrists and ankles. “Don’t think you can kill me,” he said in a low voice. “You can’t.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As soon as she was free, he retreated to his former position and again lowered himself onto the floor, where he sat staring into the distance. It was, she thought, his attempt to give her some privacy as she sat up and swung her legs over the edge of the slab. Her shift was in tatters—burned through in dozens of locations—and it did a poor job of concealing her form, not that it had covered much to begin with.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The marble floor was cool against the soles of her feet as she made her way over to Murtagh and sat next to him. She wrapped her arms around herself in an attempt to preserve her modesty.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Was Tornac really your only friend growing up?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh still did not look at her. “No, but he was as close to a father as I’ve ever had. He taught me, comforted me … berated me when I was too arrogant, and saved me from making a fool of myself more times than I can remember. If he were still alive, he would have beaten me silly for getting as drunk as I did the other day.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You said he died during your escape from Urû’baen?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He snorted. “I thought I was being clever. I bribed one of the watchmen to leave a side gate open for us. We were going to slip out of the city under the cover of darkness, and Galbatorix was only supposed to find out what had happened once it was too late to catch us. He knew from the very start, though. How, I’m not sure, but I guess he was scrying me the whole while. When Tornac and I went through the gate, we found soldiers waiting for us on the other side. … Their orders were to bring us back unharmed, but we fought, and one of them killed Tornac. The finest swordsman in all the Empire brought down by a knife in the back.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But Galbatorix let you escape.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t think he expected us to fight. Besides, his attention was directed elsewhere that night.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She frowned as she saw the oddest half smile appear on Murtagh’s face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I counted the days,” he said. “That was when the Ra’zac were in <span>Palancar</span> Valley, searching for Saphira’s egg. So you see, Eragon lost his foster father almost at the same time I lost mine. Fate has a cruel sense of humor, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes, it does. … But if Galbatorix could scry you, why didn’t he track you down and bring you back to Urû’baen later on?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He was playing with me, I think. I went to stay at the estate of a man I believed I could trust. As usual, I was mistaken, though I only found that out later, once the Twins brought me back here. Galbatorix knew where I was, and he knew I was still angry over Tornac’s death, so he was content to leave me at the estate while he hunted for Eragon and Brom. … I surprised him, though; I left, and by the time he learned of my disappearance, I was already on my way to Dras-Leona. That’s why Galbatorix went to Dras-Leona, you know. It wasn’t to chastise Lord Tábor over his behavior—although he certainly did—it was to find me. But he was too late. By the time he arrived at the city, I had already met up with Eragon and Saphira, and we had set off for Gil’ead.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why did you leave?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Didn’t Eragon tell you? Because—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, not Dras-Leona. Why did you leave the estate? You were safe there, or so you thought. So why did you leave?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh was quiet for a while. “I wanted to strike back at Galbatorix, and I wanted to make a name for myself apart from my father’s. My whole life, people have looked at me differently because I am the son of Morzan. I wanted them to respect me for <span class="italic">my</span> deeds, not his.” He finally looked at her, a quick glance out of the corner of one eye. “I suppose I got what I wanted, but again, fate has a cruel sense of humor.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She wondered if there had been anyone else in Galbatorix’s court whom he had cared for, but she decided it would be a dangerous topic to broach. So, instead, she asked, “How much does Galbatorix really know about the Varden?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Everything, so far as I can tell. He has more spies than you think.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She pressed her arms against her belly as her gut twisted. “Do you know of any way to kill him?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“A knife. A sword. An arrow. Poison. Magic. The usual ways. The problem is, he has too many spells wound about himself for anyone or anything to have a chance of harming him. Eragon is luckier than most; Galbatorix doesn’t want to kill him, so he may get to attack the king more than once. But even if Eragon could attack him a hundred times, he wouldn’t find a way past Galbatorix’s wards.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Every puzzle has a solution, and every man has a weakness,” Nasuada insisted. “Does he love any of his concubines?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The look on Murtagh’s face answered her well enough. Then he said, “Would it be so bad if Galbatorix remains king? The world he envisions is a good world. If he defeats the Varden, the whole of Alagaësia will finally be at peace. He’ll put an end to the misuse of magic; elves, dwarves, and humans will no longer have cause to hate each other. What’s more, if the Varden lose, Eragon and I can be together as brothers ought to be. But if they win, it’ll mean the death of Thorn and me. It’ll have to.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oh? And what of me?” she asked. “If Galbatorix wins, shall I become his slave, to order about as he wills?” Murtagh refused to answer, but she saw the tendons on the back of his hands tighten. “You can’t give up, Murtagh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What other choice do I have!” he shouted, filling the room with echoes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She stood and stared down at him. “You can fight! Look at me. … Look at me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He reluctantly lifted his gaze.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You can find ways to work against him. That’s what you can do! Even if your oaths will allow only the smallest of rebellions, the smallest of rebellions might still prove to be his undoing.” She restated his question for effect. “What other choice do you have? You can go around feeling helpless and miserable for the rest of your life. <span>You</span> can let Galbatorix turn you into a monster. Or you can fight!” She spread her arms so that he could see all of the burn marks on her. “Do you enjoy hurting me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No!” he exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then fight, blast you! You have to fight or you <span class="italic">will</span> lose everything you are. As will Thorn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She held her ground as he sprang to his feet, lithe as a cat, and moved toward her until he was only a few inches away. The muscles in his jaw bunched and knotted while he glowered at her, breathing heavily through his nostrils. She recognized his expression, for it was one she had seen many times before. His was the look of a man whose pride had been offended and who wanted to lash out at the person who had insulted him. It was dangerous to keep pushing him, but she knew she had to, for she might never get the chance again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“If I can keep fighting,” she said, “then so can you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Back to the stone,” he said in a harsh voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know you’re not a coward, Murtagh. Better to die than to live as a slave to one such as Galbatorix. At least then you might accomplish some good, and your name might be remembered with a measure of kindness after you’re gone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Back to the stone,” he growled, grabbing her by the arm and dragging her over to the slab.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She allowed him to push her onto the ash-colored block, fasten the restraints around her wrists and ankles, and then tighten the strap around her head. When he finished, he stood looking at her, his eyes dark and wild, the lines of his body like cords stretched taut.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You have to decide whether you are willing to risk your life in order to save yourself,” she said. “You and Thorn both. And you have to decide now, while there is still time. Ask yourself: what would Tornac have wanted you to do?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without answering, Murtagh extended his right arm and placed his hand upon the upper part of her chest, his palm hot against her skin. Her breath hitched at the shock of the contact.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then, hardly louder than a whisper, he began to speak in the ancient language. As the strange words tumbled from his lips, her fear grew ever stronger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He spoke for what seemed like minutes. She felt no different when he stopped, but that was neither a favorable nor an unfavorable sign where magic was concerned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Cool air washed over the patch on her chest, chilling it as Murtagh lifted his hand away. He stepped back then and started to walk past her, toward the entrance of the chamber. She was about to call out to him—to ask what he had done to her—when he paused and said, “That should shield you from the pain of most any wound, but you’ll have to pretend otherwise, or Galbatorix will discover what I’ve done.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And then he left.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Thank you,” she whispered to the empty room.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">She spent a long time pondering their conversation. It seemed unlikely that Galbatorix had sent Murtagh to talk with her, but unlikely or not, it remained a possibility. Also, she found herself torn as to whether Murtagh was, at heart, a good person or a bad one. She thought back to King Hrothgar—who had been like an uncle to her when she was growing up—and how Murtagh had killed him on the Burning Plains. Then she thought of Murtagh’s childhood and the many hardships he had faced, and how he had allowed Eragon and Saphira to go free when he could have just as easily brought them to Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Yet even if Murtagh had once been honorable and trustworthy, she knew that his enforced servitude might have corrupted him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the end, she decided she would ignore Murtagh’s past and judge him on his actions in the present and those alone. Good, bad, or some combination thereof, he was a potential ally, and she needed his help if she could get it. If he proved false, then she would be no worse off than she already was. But if he proved true, then she might be able to escape from Urû’baen, and that was well worth the risk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the absence of pain, she slept long and deep for the first time since her arrival at the capital. She awoke feeling more hopeful than before, and again fell to tracing the lines painted on the ceiling. The thin blue line she was following led her to notice a small white shape on the corner of a tile that she had previously overlooked. It took her a moment to realize that the discoloration was where a chip had fallen free.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sight amused her, for she found it humorous—and somewhat comforting—to know that Galbatorix’s perfect chamber was not quite so perfect after all, and that, despite his pretensions otherwise, he was not omniscient or infallible.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">When the door to the chamber next opened, it was her jailer, bringing what she guessed was a midday meal. She asked him if she could eat first, before he let her up, for she said she was more hungry than anything else, which was not entirely untrue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To her satisfaction, he agreed, though he uttered not a word, only smiled his hideous, clamplike smile and seated himself on the edge of the slab. As he spooned warm gruel into her mouth, her mind raced as she tried to plan for every contingency, for she knew she would have only one chance at success.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Anticipation made it difficult for her to stomach the bland food. Nevertheless, she managed, and when the bowl was empty and she had drunk her fill, she readied herself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The man had, as always, placed the food tray by the base of the far wall, close to where Murtagh had been sitting and perhaps ten feet from the door to the privy room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once she was free of her manacles, she slid off the block of stone. The gourd-headed man reached over to take hold of her left arm, but she raised a hand and, in her sweetest voice, said, “I can stand by myself now, thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her jailer hesitated, then he smiled again and clacked his teeth together twice, as if to say, “Well then, I’m happy for you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They started toward the privy room, she in the front and he <span>slightly</span> to the rear. As she took her third step, she deliberately twisted her right ankle and stumbled diagonally across the room. The man shouted and tried to catch her—she felt his thick fingers close on the air above her neck—but he was too slow, and she eluded his grasp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She fell lengthwise onto the tray, breaking the pitcher—which still held a fair amount of watered wine—and sending the wooden bowl clattering across the floor. By design, she landed with her right hand underneath her, and as soon as she felt the tray, she began to search with her fingers for the metal spoon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah!” she exclaimed, as if hurt, then turned to look up at the man, doing her best to appear chagrined. “Maybe I wasn’t ready after all,” she said, and gave him an apologetic smile. Her thumb touched the handle of the spoon, and she grabbed hold of it even as the man pulled her upright by her other arm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He looked her over and wrinkled his nose, appearing disgusted by her wine-soaked shift. While he did, she reached behind herself and slid the handle of the spoon through a hole near the hem of her garment. Then she held up her hand, as if to show that she had taken nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The man grunted, grabbed her other arm, and marched her to the privy room. As she entered, he shuffled back toward the tray, muttering under his breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The moment she had closed the door, she pulled the spoon out of her shift and placed it between her lips, holding it there as she plucked several strands of hair from the back of her head, where they were longest. Moving as fast as she could, she pinched one end of the gathered hairs between the fingers of her left hand and then rolled the loose strands down her thighs with the palm of her right, twisting them together into a single cord. Her skin grew cold as she realized the cord was too short. Fumbling in her urgency, she tied off the ends, then placed the cord on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She plucked another group of hairs and rolled them into a second cord, which she tied off like the first.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Knowing that she had only seconds remaining, she dropped to one knee and knotted the two strands together. Then she took the spoon from her mouth and, with the slim length of thread, she bound the spoon to the outside of her left leg, where the edge of her shift would cover it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It had to go on her left leg because Galbatorix always sat to her right.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She stood and checked that the spoon remained hidden, and then she took a few steps to make sure it would not fall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It did not.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Relieved, she allowed herself to exhale. Now her challenge was to return to the slab without letting her jailer notice what she had done.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The man was waiting for her when she opened the door to the privy room. He scowled at her, and his sparse eyebrows met, forming a single straight line.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Spoon,” he said, mashing the word with his tongue as if it were a piece of overcooked parsnip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She lifted her chin and pointed toward the rear of the privy room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His scowl deepened. He went into the room and carefully examined the walls, floors, ceiling, and all else before stomping back out. He clacked his teeth together again and scratched his bulbous head, appearing unhappy and, she thought, a little hurt that she would bother to throw away the spoon. She had been kind to him, and she knew an act of such petty defiance would puzzle him and make him angry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She resisted the urge to pull away when he stepped forward, put his weighty hands on her head, and combed through her hair with his fingers. When he did not find the spoon, his face drooped. He grabbed her arm then and walked her over to the slab and again placed her in the manacles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then, his expression sullen, he picked up the tray and shuffled out of the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She waited until she was absolutely sure he was gone before she <span>reached</span> out with the fingers of her left hand and, inch by inch, pulled up the edge of her shift.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A broad smile passed across her face as she felt the bowl of the spoon with the tip of her index finger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Now she had a weapon.</span></p>
