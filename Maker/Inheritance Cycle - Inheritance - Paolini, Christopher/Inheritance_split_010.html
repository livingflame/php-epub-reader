<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON STOOD ON</span></span> the dais in the main hall of the keep, directly to the right of Lord Bradburn’s throne, his left hand on the pommel of Brisingr, which was sheathed. On the other side of the throne stood Jörmundur—senior commander of the Varden—holding his helmet in the crook of his arm. The hair at his temples was streaked with gray; the rest was brown, and all of it was pulled back into a long braid. His lean face bore the studiously blank expression of a person who had extensive experience waiting on others. Eragon noticed a thin line of red running along the underside of Jörmundur’s right bracer, but Jörmundur showed no sign of pain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Between them sat their leader, Nasuada, resplendent in a dress of green and yellow, which she had donned just moments before, exchanging the raiment of war for garb more suited to the practice of statecraft. She too had been marked during the fighting, as was evidenced by the linen bandage wrapped around her left hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In a low voice that only Eragon and Jörmundur could hear, Nasuada said, “If we can but gain their support …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What will they want in return, though?” asked Jörmundur. “Our coffers are near empty, and our future uncertain.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her lips barely moving, she said, “Perhaps they wish nothing more of us than a chance to strike back at Galbatorix.” She paused. “But if not, we shall have to find means other than gold to persuade them to join our ranks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You could offer them barrels of cream,” said Eragon, which elicited a chortle from Jörmundur and a soft laugh from Nasuada.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Their murmured conversation came to an end as three trumpets <span>sounded</span> outside the main hall. Then a flaxen-haired page dressed in a tunic stitched with the Varden’s standard—a white dragon holding a rose above a sword pointing downward on a purple field—marched through the open doorway at the far end of the hall, struck the floor with his ceremonial staff, and, in a thin, warbling voice, announced, “His Most Exalted Royal Highness, Grimrr Halfpaw, King of the Werecats, Lord of the Lonely Places, Ruler of the Night Reaches, and He Who Walks Alone.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">A strange title, that: He Who Walks Alone</span>, Eragon observed to Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">But well deserved, I would guess</span>, she replied, and he could sense her amusement, even though he could not see her where she lay coiled in the castle keep.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The page stepped aside, and through the doorway strode Grimrr Halfpaw in the shape of a human, trailed by four other werecats, who padded close behind him on large, shaggy paws. The four resembled Solembum, the one other werecat Eragon had seen in the guise of an animal: heavy-shouldered and long-limbed, with short, dark ruffs upon their necks and withers; tasseled ears; and black-tipped tails, which they waved gracefully from side to side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Grimrr Halfpaw, however, looked unlike any person or creature Eragon had ever seen. At roughly four feet tall, he was the same height as a dwarf, but no one could have mistaken him for a dwarf, or even for a human. He had a small pointed chin, wide cheekbones, and, underneath upswept brows, slanted green eyes fringed with winglike eyelashes. His ragged black hair hung low over his forehead, while on the sides and back it fell to his shoulders, where it lay smooth and lustrous, much like the manes of his companions. His age was impossible for Eragon to guess.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The only clothes Grimrr wore were a rough leather vest and a rabbit-skin loincloth. The skulls of a dozen or so animals—birds, mice, and other small game—were tied to the front of the vest, and they rattled against one another as he moved. A sheathed dagger protruded at an angle from under the belt of his loincloth. Numerous <span>scars</span>, thin and white, marked his nut-brown skin, like scratches on a well-used table. And, as his name indicated, he was missing two fingers on his left hand; they looked to have been bitten off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Despite the delicacy of his features, there was no doubt that Grimrr was male, given the hard, sinewy muscles of his arms and chest, the narrowness of his hips, and the coiled power of his stride as he sauntered down the length of the hall toward Nasuada.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">None of the werecats seemed to notice the people lined up on either side of their path watching them until Grimrr came level with the herbalist Angela, who stood next to Roran, knitting a striped tube sock with six needles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Grimrr’s eyes narrowed as he beheld the herbalist, and his hair rippled and spiked, as did that of his four guards. His lips drew back to reveal a pair of curved white fangs, and to Eragon’s astonishment, he uttered a short, loud hiss.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Angela looked up from the sock, her expression languid and insolent. “<span class="italic">Cheep cheep</span>,” she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a moment, Eragon thought the werecat was going to attack her. A dark flush mottled Grimrr’s neck and face, his nostrils flared, and he snarled silently at her. The other werecats settled into low crouches, ready to pounce, their ears pressed flat against their heads.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Throughout the hall, Eragon heard the slither of blades being partially drawn from their scabbards.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Grimrr hissed once more, then turned away from the herbalist and continued walking. As the last werecat in line passed Angela, he lifted a paw and took a surreptitious swipe at the strand of yarn that drooped from Angela’s needles, just like a playful house cat might.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira’s bewilderment was equal to Eragon’s own. <span class="italic">Cheep cheep</span>? she asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He shrugged, forgetting that she could not see him. <span class="italic">Who knows why Angela does or says anything</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last Grimrr arrived before Nasuada. He inclined his head ever so slightly, displaying with his bearing the supreme confidence, even <span>arrogance</span>, that was the sole province of cats, dragons, and certain highborn women.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Lady Nasuada,” he said. His voice was surprisingly deep, more akin to the low, coughing roar of a wildcat than the high-pitched tones of the boy he resembled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada inclined her head in turn. “King Halfpaw. You are most welcome to the Varden, you and all your race. I must apologize for the absence of our ally, King Orrin of Surda; he could not be here to greet you, as he wished, for he and his horsemen are even now busy defending our westward flank from a contingent of Galbatorix’s troops.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Of course, Lady Nasuada,” said Grimrr. His sharp teeth flashed as he spoke. “You must never turn your back on your enemies.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Even so … And to what do we owe the unexpected pleasure of this visit, Your Highness? Werecats have always been noted for their secrecy and their solitude, and for remaining apart from the conflicts of the age, especially since the fall of the Riders. One might even say that your kind has become more myth than fact over the past century. Why, then, do you now choose to reveal yourselves?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Grimrr lifted his right arm and pointed at Eragon with a crooked finger topped by a clawlike nail.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Because of him,” growled the werecat. “One does not attack another hunter until he has shown his weakness, and Galbatorix has shown his: he will not kill Eragon Shadeslayer or Saphira Bjartskular. Long have we waited for this opportunity, and seize it we will. Galbatorix will learn to fear and hate us, and at the last, he will realize the extent of his mistake and know that we were the ones responsible for his undoing. And how sweet that revenge will taste, as sweet as the marrow of a tender young boar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Time has come, human, for every race, even werecats, to stand together and prove to Galbatorix that he has not broken our will to fight. We would join your army, Lady Nasuada, as free allies, and help you achieve this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">What Nasuada was thinking, Eragon could not tell, but he and Saphira were impressed by the werecat’s speech.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a brief pause, Nasuada said, “Your words fall most pleasantly upon my ears, Your Highness. But before I can accept your offer, there are answers I must have of you, if you are willing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With an air of unshakable indifference, Grimrr waved a hand. “I am.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Your race has been <span class="italic">so</span> secretive and <span class="italic">so</span> elusive, I must confess, I had not heard tell of Your Highness until this very day. As a point of fact, I did not even know that your race <span class="italic">had</span> a ruler.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I am not a king like your kings,” said Grimrr. “Werecats prefer to walk alone, but even we must choose a leader when to war we go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I see. Do you speak for your whole race, then, or only for those who travel with you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Grimrr’s chest swelled, and his expression became, if possible, even more self-satisfied. “I speak for all of my kind, Lady Nasuada,” he purred. “Every able-bodied werecat in Alagaësia, save those who are nursing, has come here to fight. There are few of us, but none can equal our ferocity in battle. And I can also command the one-shapes, although I cannot speak for them, for they are as dumb as other animals. Still, they will do what we ask of them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“One-shapes?” Nasuada inquired.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Those you know as cats. Those who cannot change their skins, as we do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And you command their loyalty?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye. They admire us … as is only natural.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If what he says is true</span>, Eragon commented to Saphira, <span class="italic">the werecats could prove to be incredibly valuable</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Nasuada said, “And what is it you desire of us in exchange for your assistance, King Halfpaw?” She glanced at Eragon and smiled, then added, “We can offer you as much cream as you want, but beyond that, our resources are limited. If your warriors expect to be paid for their troubles, I fear they will be sorely disappointed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Cream is for kittens, and gold holds no interest for us,” said Grimrr. As he spoke, he lifted his right hand and inspected his nails with a heavy-lidded gaze. “Our terms are thus: Each of us will be <span>given</span> a dagger to fight with, if we do not already have one. Each of us shall have two suits of armor made to fit, one for when on two legs we stand, and one for when on four. We need no other equipment than that—no tents, no blankets, no plates, no spoons. Each of us will be promised a single duck, grouse, chicken, or similar bird per day, and every second day, a bowl of freshly chopped liver. Even if we do not choose to eat it, the food will be set aside for us. Also, should you win this war, then whoever becomes your next king or queen—and all who claim that title thereafter—will keep a padded cushion next to their throne, in a place of honor, for one of us to sit on, if we so wish.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You bargain like a dwarven lawgiver,” said Nasuada in a dry tone. She leaned over to Jörmundur, and Eragon heard her whisper, “Do we have enough liver to feed them all?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I think so,” Jörmundur replied in an equally hushed voice. “But it depends on the size of the bowl.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada straightened in her seat. “Two sets of armor is one too many, King Halfpaw. Your warriors will have to decide whether they want to fight as cats or as humans and then abide by the decision. I cannot afford to outfit them for both.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">If Grimrr had had a tail, Eragon was sure it would have twitched back and forth. As it was, the werecat merely shifted his position. “Very well, Lady Nasuada.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There is one more thing. Galbatorix has spies and killers hidden everywhere. Therefore, as a condition of joining the Varden, you must consent to allow one of our spellcasters to examine your memories, so we may assure ourselves that Galbatorix has no claim on you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Grimrr sniffed. “You would be foolish not to. If anyone is brave enough to read our thoughts, let them. But not her”—and he twisted to point at Angela. “Never her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada hesitated, and Eragon could see that she wanted to ask why but restrained herself. “So be it. I will send for magicians at once, that we may settle this matter without delay. Depending on <span>what</span> they find—and it will be nothing untoward, I’m sure—I am honored to form an alliance between you and the Varden, King Halfpaw.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At her words, all of the humans in the hall broke out cheering and began to clap, including Angela. Even the elves appeared pleased.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The werecats, however, did not react, except to tilt their ears backward in annoyance at the noise.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_19"></div></body>
