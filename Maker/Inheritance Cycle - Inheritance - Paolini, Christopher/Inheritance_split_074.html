<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">EYES LOCKED, ERAGON</span></span> and Murtagh slowly circled each other, trying to anticipate where and how the other would move. Murtagh appeared fit as ever, but there were dark circles under his eyes and his face was haggard; Eragon suspected that he had been under a great strain. He wore the same pieces of armor as did Eragon: mail hauberk, gauntlets, bracers, and greaves, but his shield was longer and thinner than Eragon’s. As for their swords, Brisingr, with its hand-and-a-half hilt, had the advantage of length, while Zar’roc, with its wider blade, had the advantage of weight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They began to edge closer, and when they were about ten feet apart, Murtagh, who had his back to Galbatorix, said in a low, anger-filled voice, “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Buying time,” Eragon muttered, keeping his lips as still as possible.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh scowled. “You’re a fool. He’ll watch us cut each other to shreds, and what will it change? <span class="italic">Nothing</span>.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Instead of answering, Eragon shifted his weight forward and twitched his sword arm, causing Murtagh to flinch in response.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Blast you,” growled Murtagh. “If you had waited just one more day, I could have freed Nasuada.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">That surprised Eragon. “Why should I believe you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The question angered Murtagh further, for his lip curled and he quickened his step, causing Eragon to increase his pace as well. Then, in a louder tone, Murtagh said, “So, you finally found a proper sword for yourself. The elves made it for you, didn’t they?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You know they d—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh lunged toward him, swinging Zar’roc at his gut, and Eragon skipped backward, barely parrying the red sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon replied with a looping, overhead blow—he allowed his hand to slide down to Brisingr’s pommel to give himself more reach—and Murtagh danced out of the way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They both paused to see if the other would attack again. When neither did, they resumed circling, Eragon more wary than before.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From their exchange, it was obvious that Murtagh was still as fast and as strong as Eragon—or an elf. Galbatorix’s prohibition on the use of magic apparently did not extend to the spells that fortified Murtagh’s limbs. For selfish reasons, Eragon disliked the king’s edict, but he could understand the rationale behind it; the fight would hardly have been fair otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">But Eragon did not want a fair fight. He wanted to control the course of the duel so that he could decide when it should end, and how. Unfortunately, Eragon doubted that he would have the opportunity, given Murtagh’s skill with a blade, and even if he did, he was not sure how he could use the fight to strike against Galbatorix. Nor did he have time to think about it, though he trusted that Saphira, Arya, and the dragons would try to devise a solution for him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh feinted with his left shoulder, and Eragon ducked behind his shield. An instant later, he realized that it had been a ruse and that Murtagh was moving around toward his right in an attempt to get past his guard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon twisted and saw Zar’roc arcing toward his neck, the edge a glittering, wire-thin line. He knocked it aside with a clumsy push of Brisingr’s crossguard. Then he retaliated with a quick slash at Murtagh’s lower arm. To his grim delight, he struck Murtagh on the side of his wrist. Brisingr failed to cut through Murtagh’s gauntlet and the sleeve of the tunic beneath, but the impact still hurt Murtagh and pushed his arm away from his body, leaving his chest exposed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stabbed, and Murtagh used his shield to deflect the attack. <span>Three</span> more times Eragon stabbed, but Murtagh stopped each blow, and when Eragon drew back his arm to strike again, Murtagh countered with a backhanded cut at his knee, which would have crippled him had it landed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Seeing what Murtagh intended, Eragon altered his swing and stopped Zar’roc an inch from his leg. Then he countered with a cut of his own.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For several minutes, they exchanged blows, trying to disrupt each other’s rhythms, but to no avail. They knew each other too well. Whatever Eragon attempted, Murtagh was able to thwart, and the same was true in reverse. It was like a game where they both had to think many moves in advance, which fostered a certain sense of intimacy as Eragon focused on divining the inner workings of Murtagh’s mind and, from them, predicting, what Murtagh would do next.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Right from the beginning, Eragon noticed that Murtagh was playing the game differently than the previous times they’d fought. He attacked with a ruthlessness that heretofore had been lacking, as if, for the first time, he wanted to defeat Eragon, and quickly too. Moreover, after his initial outburst, his anger seemed to vanish, and he displayed only a cool, implacable determination.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon found himself fighting to the limit of his abilities, and though he was able to hold Murtagh off, he ended up on the defensive more than he would have liked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a while, Murtagh lowered his sword and turned toward the throne and Galbatorix.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon kept his guard up, but he hesitated, unsure whether it was appropriate to attack.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In that moment of hesitation, Murtagh leaped toward him. Eragon stood his ground and swung. Murtagh caught the blow on his shield, and then, instead of following up with a strike of his own as Eragon expected, he slammed his shield against Eragon’s and pushed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon growled and pushed back. He would have reached around <span>his</span> shield to slash at Murtagh’s back or legs, but Murtagh was shoving too hard for Eragon to risk it. Murtagh was an inch or two taller, and the extra height allowed him to bear down on Eragon’s shield in a way that made it difficult for Eragon to keep from sliding back across the polished stone floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last, with a roar and a mighty heave, Murtagh sent Eragon stumbling away. As Eragon flailed and struggled to regain his balance, Murtagh stabbed at his neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Letta!” said Galbatorix.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The tip of Zar’roc stopped less than a finger’s-breadth from Eragon’s skin. He froze, panting, not sure what had just happened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Restrain yourself, Murtagh, or I shall do it for you,” said Galbatorix from where he sat watching. “I dislike having to repeat myself. You are not to kill Eragon, nor is he to kill you. … Now, continue.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The realization that Murtagh had just tried to kill him—and that he would have succeeded if not for Galbatorix’s intervention—shocked Eragon. He searched Murtagh’s face for an explanation, but Murtagh remained stubbornly expressionless, as if Eragon meant little or nothing to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon could not understand. Murtagh was definitely playing the game differently than he ought to be. Something had changed in him, but what it was, Eragon could not tell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In addition, the knowledge that he had lost—and that, by all rights, he should be dead—undermined Eragon’s confidence. He had confronted death many times before, but never in such a stark and uncompromising manner. There was no question of it; Murtagh had bested him, and only Galbatorix’s mercy—such as it was—had saved him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Eragon, do not dwell on it</span>, said Arya. <span class="italic">You had no reason to suspect he would try to kill you. Nor were you trying to kill him. If you had, the fight would have gone differently, and Murtagh would never have had the chance to attack you as he did</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Doubtful, Eragon glanced over to where she stood by the edge of the pool of light, along with Elva and Saphira. Then Saphira said, <span class="italic"><span>If</span> he wishes to rip out your throat, then cut his hamstrings and make sure that he cannot do it again</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded, acknowledging what they had said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and Murtagh separated and again took up their positions opposite each other while Galbatorix looked on approvingly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">This time Eragon was the first to attack.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">They fought for what felt like hours. Murtagh did not attempt any more killing blows, whereas Eragon—to his satisfaction—succeeded in touching Murtagh on the collarbone, although he stopped the blow before Galbatorix saw fit to do so himself. Murtagh looked unsettled by the touch, and Eragon allowed himself a brief smile at Murtagh’s reaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There were other blows that they failed to block as well. For all their speed and skill, neither he nor Murtagh was infallible, and without an easy means to end the fight, it was inevitable that they would make mistakes and that those mistakes would result in injuries.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The first wound was a cut Murtagh gave Eragon on his right thigh, in the gap between the edge of his hauberk and the upper part of his greave. It was a shallow cut, but exceedingly painful, and every time Eragon put his weight on the leg, blood surged from the wound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The second wound was also Eragon’s: a gash above one eyebrow after Murtagh landed a blow upon his helm and the edge of it drove into his flesh. Of the two wounds, Eragon found the second by far the most aggravating, because blood kept dripping into his eye, obscuring his vision.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon caught Murtagh on the wrist again and, this time, sliced all the way through the cuff of his gauntlet, the sleeve of his tunic, and a thin layer of skin to the bone beneath. He failed to sever any muscles, but the wound seemed to pain Murtagh a great deal, and the blood that seeped into his gauntlet caused him to lose his grip at least twice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon took a nick to his right calf, and then—when Murtagh <span>was</span> still recovering from a failed attack—he moved around to Murtagh’s shield side and brought down Brisingr as hard as he could upon the middle of Murtagh’s left greave, denting the steel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh howled and jumped back on one leg. Eragon followed, swinging Brisingr in an attempt to batter him to the floor. Despite his injury, Murtagh was able to defend himself, and a few seconds later, Eragon was the one who was hard-pressed to remain on his feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a time, their shields resisted the relentless pounding—Galbatorix, Eragon was pleased to realize, had left intact the enchantments upon their swords and armor—but then the spells on Eragon’s shield gave way, as did those on Murtagh’s, which was apparent from the chips and splinters that flew every time their swords landed. Soon afterward, Eragon cracked Murtagh’s shield with a particularly heavy blow. His victory was short-lived, for Murtagh grasped Zar’roc with both hands and struck at Eragon’s own shield twice in quick succession, and it split as well, leaving them equally matched once again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As they fought, the stone beneath them grew slippery with smears and splashes of blood, and it became increasingly difficult to keep their footing. The massive presence chamber returned distant echoes of their clashing weapons—like the sounds of a long-forgotten battle—and it felt as if they were the center of all that existed, for theirs was the only light, and the two of them were alone within its compass.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And all the while, Galbatorix and Shruikan continued to watch from within the bordering shadows.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without their shields, Eragon found it easier to land blows upon Murtagh—mainly upon his arms and legs—even as it was easier for Murtagh to do the same to him. For the most part, their armor protected them from cuts, but it did not protect them from lumps and bruises, of which they accrued many.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In spite of the wounds he gave Murtagh, Eragon began to suspect that, of the two of them, Murtagh was the better swordsman. Not by <span>much</span>, but enough that Eragon was never really able to gain the upper hand. If the course of their duel continued, Murtagh would end up wearing him down until he was too hurt or too tired to go on, an outcome that seemed to be fast approaching. With every step, Eragon could feel the blood gushing over his knee from the cut on his thigh, and with every moment that passed, it became harder to defend himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He had to end the duel now or else he would be unable to take on Galbatorix afterward. As it was, he doubted he would pose much of a challenge to the king, but he had to try. If nothing else, he had to try.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The heart of the problem, he realized, was that Murtagh’s reasons for fighting were a mystery to him, and unless he could figure them out, Murtagh would continue to catch him by surprise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon thought back to what Glaedr had told him outside Dras-Leona: <span class="italic">You must learn to see what you are looking at</span>. And also: <span class="italic">The way of the warrior is the way of knowing</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So he looked at Murtagh. He looked at him with the same intensity with which he had gazed upon Arya during their sparring sessions, the same intensity with which he had studied himself during his long night of introspection on Vroengard. By it, he sought to decipher the hidden language of Murtagh’s body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He met with some success; it was clear that Murtagh was drawn and hard-worn, and his shoulders were hunched in a way that spoke of deep-rooted anger, or perhaps it was fear. And then there was his ruthlessness, hardly a new characteristic, but newly applied to Eragon. Those things Eragon discerned, along with other, subtler details, and then he strove to reconcile them with what he knew of Murtagh from days past, with his friendship and his loyalty and his resentment of Galbatorix’s control.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took a few seconds—seconds filled with strained breathing and a pair of awkward blows that gained him another bruise on his elbow—until the truth came to Eragon. It seemed so obvious when it did. There had to be something in Murtagh’s life, something their <span>duel</span> would affect, that was so important to Murtagh, he felt compelled to win by any means necessary, even if that meant killing his own half brother. Whatever that something was—and Eragon had his suspicions, some more disturbing than others—it meant that Murtagh would never give up. It meant Murtagh would fight like a cornered animal until his very last breath, and it meant Eragon would never be able to defeat him through conventional measures, for the duel did not mean as much to him as it did to Murtagh. For Eragon, the duel was a convenient distraction, and he cared little who won or lost as long as he was still able to face Galbatorix afterward. But for Murtagh, the duel was of far more significance, and from experience, Eragon knew that determination such as his was costly, if not impossible, to overcome by force alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The question, then, was how to stop a man who was resolved to persist and prevail in spite of whatever obstacles barred his way.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was an unsolvable conundrum until, at last, Eragon realized that the only way to best Murtagh was to give him what he wanted. In order to achieve his own desire, Eragon would have to accept defeat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">But not entirely. He could not leave Murtagh free to carry out Galbatorix’s bidding. Eragon would grant Murtagh his victory, and then he would take his own.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As she listened to his thoughts, Saphira’s anguish and concern grew more pronounced, and she said, <span class="italic">No, Eragon. There must be another way</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then tell me what it is</span>, he said, <span class="italic">for I cannot see it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She snarled, and Thorn growled back at her from across the pool of light.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Choose wisely</span>, said Arya, and Eragon understood her meaning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh rushed at him, and their blades met with a clamorous ring, and then they disengaged and paused a moment to gather their strength. As they started toward each other once again, Eragon sidled to Murtagh’s right, while at the same time allowing his sword arm to drift away from the side of his body, as if through exhaustion <span>or</span> carelessness. It was a slight motion, but he knew that Murtagh would notice and that he would attempt to exploit the opening he had provided.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At that moment, Eragon felt nothing. He still registered the pain from his wounds, but at a remove, as if the sensations were not his own. His mind was like a pool of deep water on a breathless day, flat and motionless, and yet filled with the reflection of those things around it. What he saw, he registered without conscious thought. The need for that had passed. He understood all that was before him, and further contemplation would only hamper him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Eragon expected, Murtagh lunged toward him, stabbing at the middle of his belly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When the time was ripe, Eragon turned. He moved neither fast nor slow but at just the right speed the situation required. The motion felt preordained, as if it were the only action he could have taken.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Instead of striking him in the gut, as Murtagh had intended, Zar’roc struck Eragon in the muscles along his right side, directly below his ribcage. The impact felt like a hammerblow, and there was a steely slither as Zar’roc slid past the broken links of his mail and into his flesh. The coldness of the metal made Eragon gasp more than the pain itself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind him, the tip of the blade tugged at his hauberk as it emerged from his body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh stared, seemingly taken aback.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before Murtagh could recover, Eragon drew back his arm and thrust Brisingr into Murtagh’s abdomen, close to his navel: a far worse wound than the one Eragon had just received.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh’s face went slack. His mouth opened as if he were going to speak, and he fell to his knees, still clutching Zar’roc.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Off to the side, Thorn roared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon pulled Brisingr free, then stepped back and grimaced in a soundless howl as Zar’roc slid out of his body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There was a clatter as Murtagh released Zar’roc and it dropped to <span>the</span> floor. Then he wrapped his arms around his waist, doubled over, and pressed his head against the polished stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Now Eragon was the one to stare, hot blood dripping into one eye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From on his throne, Galbatorix said, “Naina,” and dozens of lanterns throughout the chamber sprang to life, once again revealing the pillars and carvings along the walls and the block of stone where Nasuada stood chained.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon staggered over to Murtagh and knelt next to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And to Eragon goes the victory,” said the king, his sonorous voice filling the great hall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh looked up at Eragon, his sweat-beaded face contorted with pain. “You couldn’t just let me win, could you?” he growled in an undertone. “You can’t beat Galbatorix, but you still had to prove that you are better than me. … Ah!” He shuddered and began to rock back and forth upon his shins.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon put a hand on his shoulder. “Why?” he asked, knowing that Murtagh would understand the question.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The answer came as a barely audible whisper: “Because I hoped to gain his favor so that I could save <span class="italic">her</span>.” Tears blurred Murtagh’s eyes, and he looked away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At that, Eragon realized that Murtagh had been telling the truth earlier, and he felt a sense of dismay.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Another moment passed, and Eragon was aware of Galbatorix watching them with keen interest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Murtagh said, “You tricked me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It was the only way.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Murtagh grunted. “That was always the difference between you and me.” He eyed Eragon. “You were willing to sacrifice yourself. I wasn’t. … Not then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But now you are.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m not the person I once was. I have Thorn now, and …” Murtagh hesitated; then his shoulders rose and fell in a tiny shrug. “I’m not fighting for myself anymore. … It makes a difference.” He took a shallow breath and winced. “I used to think you were a fool <span>to</span> keep risking your life as you have. … I know better now. I understand … why. I understand. …” His eyes widened and his grimace relaxed, as if his pain was forgotten, and an inner light seemed to illuminate his features. “I understand—<span class="italic">we</span> understand,” he whispered, and Thorn uttered a strange sound that was half whimper and half growl.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix stirred on his throne, as if uneasy, and in a harsh voice, he said, “Enough of this talk. Your duel is over, and Eragon has won. Now the time has arrived for our guests to bend their knees and give to me their oaths of fealty. … Come closer, the both of you, and I shall heal your wounds, and then we shall proceed.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon started to stand, but Murtagh grabbed his forearm, stopping him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Now!” said Galbatorix, his heavy brows drawing together. “Or I will leave you to suffer from your wounds until we have finished.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Ready yourself</span>, Murtagh mouthed to Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hesitated, not sure what to expect; then he nodded and warned Arya, Saphira, Glaedr, and the other Eldunarí.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Murtagh pushed Eragon aside, and he rose up on his knees, still clutching his belly. He looked at Galbatorix. And he shouted the Word.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix recoiled and lifted a hand, as if to shield himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Still shouting, Murtagh voiced other words in the ancient language, speaking too quickly for Eragon to understand the purpose of the spell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The air around Galbatorix flashed red and black, and for an instant, his body appeared to be wreathed in flames. There was a sound like that of a high summer wind stirring the branches of an evergreen forest. Then Eragon heard a series of thin shrieks as twelve orbs of light appeared around Galbatorix’s head and fled outward from him and passed through the walls of the chamber and thus vanished. They looked like spirits, but Eragon saw them for such a brief span, he could not be certain.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Thorn spun around—as fast as a cat whose tail has been stepped <span>on</span>—and he pounced on Shruikan’s immense neck. The black dragon bellowed and scrambled backward, shaking his head in an attempt to throw Thorn off. The noise of his growls was painfully loud, and the floor shook from the weight of the two dragons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On the steps of the dais, the two children screamed and covered their ears with their hands.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon saw Arya, Elva, and Saphira lurch forward, no longer bound by Galbatorix’s magic. Dauthdaert in hand, Arya started toward the throne, while Saphira loped toward where Thorn clung to Shruikan. Meanwhile, Elva put her hand to her mouth and seemed to say something to herself, but what it was Eragon could not hear over the sound of the dragons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Fist-sized drops of blood rained down around them and lay smoking on the stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon rose from where Murtagh had pushed him, and he followed Arya toward the throne.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Galbatorix spoke the name of the ancient language, along with the word <span class="italic">letta</span>. Invisible bonds seized hold of Eragon’s limbs, and throughout the chamber, silence fell as the king’s magic restrained everyone, even Shruikan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Rage and frustration boiled within Eragon. They had been so close to striking at the king, and still they were helpless before his spells. “<span class="italic">Get him!”</span> he shouted, both with his mind and his tongue. They had already tried to attack Galbatorix and Shruikan; the king would kill the two children whether or not they continued. The only path left to Eragon and those with him—the only hope of victory that yet remained—was to break past Galbatorix’s mental barriers and seize control of his thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Along with Saphira and Arya and the Eldunarí they had brought with them, Eragon stabbed outward with his consciousness toward the king, pouring all his hate, anger, and pain into the single, burning ray that he drove into the center of Galbatorix’s being.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For an instant, Eragon felt the king’s mind: a terrible, shadow <span>ridden</span> vista swept with bitter cold and searing heat—ruled by bars of iron, hard and unyielding, which portioned off areas of his consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the dragons under Galbatorix’s command, the mad, howling, grief-stricken dragons, attacked Eragon’s mind and forced him to withdraw within himself to avoid being torn to pieces.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind him, Eragon heard Elva start to say something, but she had barely uttered a sound when Galbatorix said, “Theyna!” and she stopped with a choked gurgle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I stripped him of his wards!” shouted Murtagh. “He’s—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Whatever Galbatorix said, it was too fast and too low for Eragon to catch, but Murtagh ceased speaking, and a moment later, Eragon heard him fall to the floor with a tinkle of mail and the sharp clink of his helm striking stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I have plenty of wards,” said Galbatorix, his hawklike face dark with fury. “You cannot harm me.” He rose from his seat and strode down the steps of the dais toward Eragon, his cape billowing around him and his sword, Vrangr, white and deathly in his hand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the brief time he had, Eragon tried to capture the mind of at least one of the dragons battering at his consciousness, but there were too many, and his attempt left him scrambling to repel the horde of Eldunarí before they completely subjugated his thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix stopped a foot in front of him and glared at him, a thick, forked vein prominent on his brow, the muscles of his heavy jaw knotting. “Think you to challenge me, <span class="italic">boy</span>?” he growled, fairly spitting with rage. “Think you to be my equal? That you could lay me low and steal my throne?” The cords in Galbatorix’s neck stood out like a skein of twisted rope. He plucked at the edge of his cape. “I cut this mantle from the wings of Belgabad himself, and my gloves too.” He lifted Vrangr and held its bleak blade before Eragon’s eyes. “I took this sword from Vrael’s hand, and I took this crown from the head of the mewling wretch who wore it before me. And yet you think to outwit me? <span class="italic">Me</span>? You come to my castle, and you kill my <span>men</span>, and you act as if you are <span class="italic">better</span> than I. As if you are more <span class="italic">noble</span> or <span class="italic">virtuous</span>.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s head rang, and a constellation of throbbing, swirling crimson motes appeared before his eyes as Galbatorix struck him on the cheek with Vrangr’s pommel, tearing his skin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You need to be taught a lesson in humility, boy,” said Galbatorix, moving closer, until his gleaming eyes were mere inches from Eragon’s.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He struck Eragon on the other cheek, and for a second, all Eragon could see was a black immensity littered with flashing lights.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I shall <span class="italic">enjoy</span> having you in my service,” said Galbatorix. In a lower voice, he said, “Gánga,” and the pressure from the Eldunarí assailing Eragon’s mind vanished, leaving him free to think as he would. But not so the others, as he could see from the strain on their faces.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then a blade of thought, honed to an infinitesimal point, pierced Eragon’s consciousness and sheathed itself in the marrow of his being. The blade twisted and, like a cocklebur lodged within a batt of felt, it tore at the fabric of his mind, seeking to destroy his will, his identity, his very awareness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was an attack unlike any Eragon had experienced. He shrank from it and concentrated upon a single thought—revenge—as he struggled to protect himself. Through their contact, he could feel Galbatorix’s emotions: anger, mainly, but also a savage joy at being able to hurt Eragon and watch him writhe in discomfort.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The reason, Eragon realized, that Galbatorix was so good at breaking the minds of his enemies was because it gave him a perverse pleasure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The blade dug deeper into Eragon’s being and he howled, unable to help himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix smiled, the edges of his teeth translucent, like fired clay.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Defense alone was no way to win a fight, and so, despite the searing pain, Eragon forced himself to attack Galbatorix in return. He dove into the king’s consciousness and grasped at his razor-sharp <span>thoughts</span>, trying to pin them in place and prevent the king from moving or thinking without his approval.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix made no attempt to guard himself, however. His cruel smile widened, and he twisted the blade in Eragon’s mind even further.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It felt to Eragon as if a nest of briars were ripping him apart from the inside. A scream racked his throat, and he went limp in the grip of Galbatorix’s spell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Submit,” said the king. He grabbed Eragon’s chin with fingers of steel. “Submit.” The blade twisted yet again, and Eragon screamed until his voice gave out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king’s probing thoughts closed in around Eragon’s consciousness, restricting him to an ever-smaller part of his mind, until all that was left to him was a small, bright nub overshadowed by the looming weight of Galbatorix’s presence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Submit,” the king whispered, almost lovingly. “You have nowhere to go, nowhere to hide. … This life is at an end for you, Eragon Shadeslayer, but a new one awaits. Submit, and all shall be forgiven.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Tears distorted Eragon’s vision as he stared into the featureless abyss of Galbatorix’s pupils.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They had lost. … <span class="italic">He</span> had lost.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The knowledge was more painful than any of the wounds he had received. A hundred years’ worth of striving—all for naught. Saphira, Elva, Arya, the Eldunarí: none of them could overcome Galbatorix. He was too strong, too knowledgeable. Garrow and Brom and Oromis had all died in vain, as had the many warriors of different races who had laid down their lives in the course of fighting the Empire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The tears spilled from Eragon’s eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Submit,” whispered the king, and his grip tightened.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">More than anything, it was the injustice of the situation that Eragon hated. It seemed <span class="italic">wrong</span> on a fundamental level that so many had suffered and died in pursuit of a hopeless goal. It seemed <span class="italic">wrong</span>
<span>that</span> Galbatorix alone should be the cause of so much misery. And it seemed <span class="italic">wrong</span> that he should escape punishment for his misdeeds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why</span>? Eragon asked himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He remembered, then, the vision the oldest of the Eldunarí, Valdr, had shown him and Saphira, where the dreams of starlings were equal to the concerns of kings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Submit!” shouted Galbatorix, and his mind bore down on Eragon with even greater force as splinters of ice and fire lanced through him from every direction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon cried out, and in his desperation he reached for Saphira and the Eldunarí—their minds besieged by the crazed dragons of Galbatorix’s command—and without intending to, he drew from their stores of energy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And with that energy, he cast a spell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was a spell without words, for Galbatorix’s magic would not allow otherwise, and no words could have described what Eragon wanted, nor what he felt. A library of books would have been insufficient to the task. His was a spell of instinct and emotion; language could not contain it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">What he wanted was both simple and complex: he wanted Galbatorix to <span class="italic">understand</span> … to understand the wrongness of his actions. The spell was not an attack; it was an attempt to communicate. If Eragon was going to spend the rest of his life as a slave to the king, then he wanted Galbatorix to comprehend what he had done, fully and completely.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the magic took effect, Eragon felt Umaroth and the Eldunarí turn their attention to his spell, fighting to ignore Galbatorix’s dragons. A hundred years of inconsolable grief and anger welled up within the Eldunarí, like a roaring wave, and the dragons melded their minds with Eragon’s and began to alter the spell, deepening it, widening it, and building upon it until it encompassed far more than he originally intended.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Not only would the spell show Galbatorix the wrongness of his actions; now it would also compel him to experience all the <span>feelings</span>, both good and bad, that he had aroused in others since the day he had been born. The spell was beyond any Eragon could have invented on his own, for it contained more than a single person, or a single dragon, could conceive of. Each Eldunarí contributed to the enchantment, and the sum of their contributions was a spell that extended not only across the whole of Alagaësia but also back through every moment in time between then and Galbatorix’s birth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was, Eragon thought, the greatest piece of magic the dragons had ever wrought, and he was their instrument; he was their weapon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The power of the Eldunarí rushed through him, like a river as wide as an ocean, and he felt a hollow and fragile vessel, as if his skin might tear with the force of the torrent he channeled. If not for Saphira and the other dragons, he would have died in an instant, drained of all strength by the voracious demands of the magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Around them, the light of the lanterns dimmed, and in his mind, Eragon seemed to hear the echo of thousands of voices: an unbearable cacophony of pains and joys innumerable, echoing forth from both the present and the past.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The lines upon Galbatorix’s face deepened, and his eyes began to bulge from their sockets. “What have you done?” he said, his voice hollow and strained. He stepped back and put his fists to his temples. “<span class="italic">What have you done!”</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With an effort, Eragon said, “Made you understand.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king stared at him with an expression of horror. The muscles of his face jumped and twitched, and his whole body began to shake with tremors. Baring his teeth, he growled, “You will not get the better of me, boy. You … will … not. …” He groaned and staggered, and all at once the spell holding Eragon vanished and he fell to the floor, even as Elva, Arya, Saphira, Thorn, Shruikan, and the two children began to move again as well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A deafening roar from Shruikan filled the chamber, and the huge black dragon shook Thorn off his neck, sending the red dragon <span>flying</span> halfway across the room. Thorn landed on his left side, and the bones in his wing broke with a loud <span class="italic">snap</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I … shall … not … give … in,” said Galbatorix. Behind the king, Eragon saw Arya—who was closer to the throne than Eragon—hesitate and look back at them. Then she sprinted past the dais and ran with Saphira toward Shruikan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Thorn struggled to his feet and followed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His face contorted like a madman’s, Galbatorix strode toward Eragon and swung Vrangr at him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon rolled to the side and heard the sword strike the stone by his head. He kept rolling for another few feet, then pushed himself into a standing position. Only the energy from the Eldunarí allowed him to remain upright.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Shouting, Galbatorix charged at him, and Eragon deflected the king’s clumsy blow. Their swords rang like bells, sharp and clear amid the roars of dragons and the whispers of the dead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira leaped high into the air and batted at Shruikan’s enormous snout, bloodying it, then dropped back to the floor. He swung a paw at her, talons extended, and she hopped backward, half spreading her wings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon ducked a savage crosscut and stabbed at Galbatorix’s left armpit. To his astonishment, he scored a hit, wetting the tip of Brisingr with the king’s blood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A spasm in Galbatorix’s arm threw off his next strike, and they ended up with their swords locked at the hilt, both striving to push each other off balance. The king’s face was twisted almost beyond recognition, and there were tears on his cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A sheet of flame erupted over their heads, and the air grew hot around them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Somewhere the children were screaming.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s wounded leg gave way, and he fell back onto his hands and feet, bruising the fingers with which he held Brisingr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He expected the king to be upon him within a second, but instead Galbatorix remained where he was, swaying from side to side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No!” cried the king. “I didn’t. …” He looked at Eragon and shouted, “Make it stop!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shook his head even while he scrambled back onto his feet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Pain shot through his left arm, and he looked over to see Saphira with a bloody gash on her corresponding foreleg. On the other side of the room, Thorn sank his teeth into Shruikan’s tail, causing the black dragon to snarl and turn on him. While Shruikan’s attention was directed elsewhere, Saphira sprang upward and landed atop his neck, close to the base of his bony skull. She hooked her claws under his scales and then bit down on his neck between two of the spikes that ran along his spine.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Shruikan let out a rumbling, savage yowl and began to thrash about even more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once again Galbatorix ran at Eragon, slashing at him as he did. Eragon blocked one blow, then another, and then took a hit on his ribs, which nearly caused him to black out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Make it stop,” said Galbatorix, his tone more pleading than threatening. “The pain …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Another yowl, this one more frantic than the last, came from Shruikan. Behind the king, Eragon saw Thorn clinging to Shruikan’s neck, opposite Saphira. The combined weight of the two dragons pulled down Shruikan’s head until it was close to the floor. However, the black dragon was still too large and strong for them to subdue. Moreover, his neck was so thick, Eragon did not think either Saphira or Thorn would be able to hurt him much with their teeth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then, like a shadow flitting through a forest, Eragon saw Arya dart out from behind a pillar and run toward the dragons. In her left hand, the green Dauthdaert glowed with its usual starry nimbus.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Shruikan saw her coming and jerked his body, trying to dislodge Saphira and Thorn. When they remained affixed, he snarled and opened his jaws and painted the area in front of him with a torrent of fire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya dove forward, and for a moment, Eragon lost sight of her behind the wall of flames. Then she came into view again, not far <span>from</span> where Shruikan’s head hung above the floor. The ends of her hair were on fire, but she seemed not to notice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With three bounding steps, she leaped onto Shruikan’s left forefoot, and from there flung herself toward the side of his head, trailing fire like a comet. Uttering a shout that could be heard throughout the throne room, Arya threw the Dauthdaert into the center of Shruikan’s great, gleaming ice-blue eye and buried the full length of the spear within his skull.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Shruikan bellowed and twitched, and then he slowly fell sideways, liquid fire pouring from his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira and Thorn jumped clear a moment before the gigantic black dragon struck the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Pillars cracked; chunks of stone fell from the ceiling and shattered. A number of lanterns broke, and gouts of some molten substance dribbled out of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nearly fell as the room shuddered. He had not been able to see what had happened to Arya, but he feared that Shruikan’s bulk might have crushed her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eragon!” shouted Elva. “Duck!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He ducked, and he heard a whistle of wind as Galbatorix’s white blade swung over his lowered back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Rising, Eragon lunged forward …</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">… and stabbed Galbatorix in the center of his stomach, even as he had stabbed Murtagh.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The king grunted, and then he stepped back, pulling himself off Eragon’s blade. He touched the wound with his free hand and stared at the blood on the tips of his fingers. Then he looked back at Eragon and said, “The voices … the voices are terrible. I can’t bear it. …” He closed his eyes, and fresh tears streamed down his cheeks. “Pain … so much pain. So much grief. … Make it stop! <span class="italic">Make it stop!</span>”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Eragon. Elva joined him, as did Saphira and Thorn from the other end of the room. With them, Eragon was relieved to see, was Arya, burned and bloodied, but otherwise unhurt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Galbatorix’s eyes snapped open—round and rimmed with an unnatural amount of white—and he stared into the distance, as if Eragon and those before him no longer existed. He shook and trembled and his jaw worked, but no sound came from his throat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Two things happened at once, then. Elva let out a shriek and fainted, and Galbatorix shouted, “Waíse néiat!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Be not.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon had no time for words. Again drawing upon the Eldunarí, he cast a spell to drag himself, Saphira, Arya, Elva, Thorn, Murtagh, and the two children on the dais over to the block of stone where Nasuada was chained. And he also cast a spell to stop or deflect whatever might harm them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They were only halfway to the block when Galbatorix vanished in a flash of light brighter than the sun. Then all went black and silent as Eragon’s protective spell took effect.</span></p>
