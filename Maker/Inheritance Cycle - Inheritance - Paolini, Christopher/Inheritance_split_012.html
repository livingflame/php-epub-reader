<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">“<span><span class="calibre27">G<span class="italic">ALBATORIX IS MAD</span></span></span>
<span class="italic">and therefore unpredictable, but he also has gaps in his reasoning that an ordinary person would not. If you can find those, Eragon, then perhaps you and Saphira can defeat him</span>.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Brom lowered his pipe, his face grave. “I hope you do. My greatest desire, Eragon, is that you and Saphira will live long and fruitful lives, free from fear of Galbatorix and the Empire. I wish that I could protect you from all of the dangers that threaten you, but alas, that is not within my ability. All I can do is give you my advice and teach you what I can</span> now <span class="italic">while I am still here. … My son. Whatever happens to you, know that I love you, and so did your mother. May the stars watch over you, Eragon Bromsson</span>.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon opened his eyes as the memory faded. Above him, the ceiling of the tent sagged inward, as loose as an empty waterskin, after the battering it had received during the now-departed storm. A drop of water fell from the belly of a fold, struck his right thigh, and soaked through his leggings, chilling the skin beneath. He knew he would have to go tighten up the tent’s support ropes, but he was reluctant to move from the cot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And Brom never said anything to you about Murtagh? He never told you that Murtagh and I were half brothers</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira, who was curled up outside the tent, said, <span class="italic">Asking again won’t change my answer</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Why wouldn’t he, though? Why didn’t he? He must have known about Murtagh. He couldn’t</span> not <span class="italic">have</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira’s response was slow to come. <span class="italic">Brom’s reasons were ever his <span>own</span>, but if I had to guess, I imagine he thought it more important to tell you how he cared for you, and to give you what advice he could, than to spend his time talking about Murtagh</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">He could have warned me, though! Just a few words would have sufficed</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I cannot say for certain what drove him, Eragon. You have to accept that there are some questions you will never be able to answer about Brom. Trust in his love for you, and do not allow such concerns to disturb you</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stared down his chest at his thumbs. He placed them side by side, to better compare them. His left thumb had more wrinkles on its second joint than did his right, while his right had a small, ragged scar that he could not remember getting, although it must have happened since the Agaetí Blödhren, the Blood-oath Celebration.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Thank you</span>, he said to Saphira. Through her, he had watched and listened to Brom’s message three times since the fall of Feinster, and each time he had noticed some detail of Brom’s speech or movement that had previously escaped him. The experience comforted and satisfied him, for it fulfilled a desire that had plagued him his entire life: to know the name of his father and to know that his father cared for him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira acknowledged his thanks with a warm glow of affection.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Though Eragon had eaten and then rested for perhaps an hour, his weariness had not entirely abated. Nor had he expected it to. He knew from experience that it could take weeks to fully recover from the debilitating effects of a long, drawn-out battle. As the Varden approached Urû’baen, he and everyone else in Nasuada’s army would have less and less time to recover before each new confrontation. The war would wear them down until they were bloody, battered, and barely able to fight, at which point they would still have to face Galbatorix, who would have been waiting for them in ease and comfort.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He tried not to think about it too much.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Another drop of water struck his leg, cold and hard. Irritated, he swung his legs off the edge of the cot and sat upright, then went over to the bare patch of dirt in one corner and knelt next to it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Deloi sharjalví!” he said, as well as several other phrases in the ancient language that were necessary to disarm the traps he had set the previous day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The dirt began to seethe like water coming to a boil, and rising out of the churning fountain of rocks, insects, and worms, there emerged an ironbound chest a foot and a half in length. Reaching out, Eragon took hold of the chest and released his spell. The ground grew calm once more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He set the chest on the now-solid dirt. “Ládrin,” he whispered, and waved his hand past the lock with no keyhole that secured the hasp. It popped open with a <span class="italic">click</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A faint golden glow filled the tent as he lifted the lid of the chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nestled securely within the velvet-lined interior lay Glaedr’s Eldunarí, the dragon’s heart of hearts. The large, jewel-like stone glittered darkly, like a dying ember. Eragon cupped the Eldunarí between his hands, the irregular, sharp-edged facets warm against his palms, and stared into its pulsing depths. A galaxy of tiny stars swirled within the center of the stone, although their movement had slowed and there seemed to be far fewer than when Eragon had first beheld the stone in Ellesméra, when Glaedr had discharged it from his body and into Eragon and Saphira’s care.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As always, the sight fascinated Eragon; he could have sat watching the ever-changing pattern for days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We should try again</span>, said Saphira, and he agreed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Together they reached out with their minds toward the distant lights, toward the sea of stars that represented Glaedr’s consciousness. Through cold and darkness they sailed, then heat and despair and indifference so vast and so great, it sapped their will to do anything other than to stop and weep.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Glaedr … Elda</span>, they cried over and over, but there was no answer, no shifting of the indifference.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last they withdrew, unable to withstand the crushing weight of Glaedr’s misery any longer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he returned to himself, Eragon became aware of someone knocking on the front pole of his tent, and then he heard Arya say, “Eragon? May I enter?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He sniffed and blinked to clear his eyes. “Of course.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The dim gray light from the cloudy sky fell upon him as Arya pushed aside the entrance flap. He felt a sudden pang as his eyes met hers—green, slanted, and unreadable—and an ache of longing filled him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Has there been any change?” she asked, and came to kneel by him. Instead of armor, she was wearing the same black leather shirt, trousers, and thin-soled boots as when he had rescued her in Gil’ead. Her hair was damp from washing and hung down her back in long, heavy ropes. The scent of crushed pine needles attended her, as it so often did, and it occurred to Eragon to wonder whether she used a spell to create the aroma or if that was how she smelled naturally. He would have liked to ask her, but he did not dare.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In answer to her question, he shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“May I?” She indicated Glaedr’s heart of hearts.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He moved out of the way. “Please.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya placed her hands on either side of the Eldunarí and then closed her eyes. While she sat, he took the opportunity to study her with an openness and intensity that would have been offensive otherwise. In every aspect, she seemed the epitome of beauty, even though he knew that another might say her nose was too long, or her face too angled, or her ears too pointed, or her arms too muscled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a sharp intake of breath, Arya jerked her hands away from the heart of hearts, as if it had burned her. Then she bowed her head, and Eragon saw her chin quiver ever so faintly. “He is the most unhappy creature I have ever met. … I would we could help <span>him</span>. I do not think he will be able to find his way out of the darkness on his own.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you think …” Eragon hesitated, not wanting to give voice to his suspicion, then continued: “Do you think he will go mad?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He may have already. If not, then he dances on the very cusp of insanity.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Sorrow came over Eragon as they both gazed at the golden stone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When at last he was able to bring himself to speak again, he asked, “Where is the Dauthdaert?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Hidden within my tent even as you have hidden Glaedr’s Eldunarí. I can bring it here, if you want, or I can continue to safeguard it until you need it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Keep it. I can’t carry it around with me, or Galbatorix may learn of its existence. Besides, it would be foolish to store so many treasures in one place.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The ache inside of Eragon intensified. “Arya, I—” He stopped as Saphira saw one of the blacksmith Horst’s sons—Albriech, he thought, although it was difficult to tell him from his brother, Baldor, because of the distortions in Saphira’s vision—running toward the tent. The interruption relieved Eragon, as he had not known what he was going to say.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Someone’s coming,” he announced, and closed the lid of the chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Loud, wet footsteps sounded in the mud outside. Then Albriech, for it was Albriech, shouted, “Eragon! Eragon!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mother’s birth pains have just begun! Father sent me to tell you and to ask if you will wait with him, in case anything goes wrong and your skill with magic is needed. Please, if you can—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Whatever else he said was lost to Eragon as he rushed to lock and bury the chest. Then he cast his cloak over his shoulders and was fumbling with the clasp when Arya touched him on the arm and <span>said</span>, “May I accompany you? I have some experience with this. If your people will let me, I can make the birth easier for her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon did not even pause to consider his decision. He motioned toward the entrance of the tent. “After you.”</span></p>
