<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">IT WAS LATE</span></span> afternoon when Eragon opened his eyes. The blanket of clouds had broken in several places, and beams of golden light planked the valley floor, illuminating the tops of the ruined buildings. Though the valley still looked cold and wet and unwelcoming, the light gave it a newfound majesty. For the first time, Eragon understood why the Riders had chosen to settle on the island.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He yawned, then glanced over at Saphira and lightly touched her mind. She was still asleep, lost in a dreamless slumber. Her consciousness was like a flame that had dimmed until it was little more than a smoldering coal, a coal that might just as easily go out as flare up again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The feeling unsettled him—it reminded him too much of death—so he returned to his own mind and restricted their contact to a narrow thread of thought: just enough so that he could be sure of her safety.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the forest behind him, a pair of squirrels began to swear at each other with a series of high-pitched shrieks. He frowned as he listened; their voices sounded a bit too sharp, a bit too fast, a bit too warbly. It was as if some other creature was imitating the cries of the squirrels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The thought made his scalp prickle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He lay where he was for over an hour, listening to the shrieks and chattering that emanated from the woods and watching the patterns of light as they played across the hills, fields, and mountains of the bowl-shaped valley. Then the gaps in the clouds closed, the sky darkened, and snow began to fall on the upper flanks of the mountains, painting them white.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon rose and said to Glaedr, <span class="italic">I’m going to gather some firewood. I’ll be back in a few minutes</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The dragon acknowledged him, and Eragon carefully made his way across the meadow to the forest, doing his best to be quiet so as not to disturb Saphira. Once he was at the trees, he quickened his pace. Although there were plenty of dead branches along the verge of the forest, he wanted to stretch his legs and, if he could, find the source of the chattering.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Shadows lay heavy under the trees. The air was cool and still, like that of a cave deep underground, and it smelled of fungus, rotting wood, and oozing sap. The moss and lichen that trailed from the branches were like lengths of tattered lace, stained and sodden but still possessed of a certain delicate beauty. They partitioned the interior of the woods into cells of varying size, which made it difficult to see more than fifty feet in any direction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon used the burbling of the brook to determine his bearings as he worked his way deeper into the forest. Now that he was close to them, he saw that the evergreens were unlike those from the Spine or even from Du Weldenvarden; they had clusters of seven needles instead of three, and though it might have been a trick of the fading light, it seemed to him as if darkness clung to the trees, like a cloak wrapped around their trunks and branches. Also, everything about the trees, from the cracks in the bark to their protruding roots to their scaled cones—everything about them had a peculiar angularity and a fierceness of line that made them appear as if they were about to pull themselves free of the earth and stride down to the city below.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shivered and loosened Brisingr in its scabbard. He had never before been in a forest that felt so menacing. It was as if the trees were <span class="italic">angry</span> and—as with the apple grove earlier—as if they wanted to reach out and rend his flesh from his bones.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With the back of his hand, he brushed aside a swath of yellow lichen as he cautiously made his way forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So far he had seen no sign of game, nor had he found any evidence <span>of</span> wolves or bears, which puzzled him. That close to the stream, there should have been trails leading to the water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Maybe the animals avoid this part of the woods</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">But why</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A fallen log lay across his path. He stepped over it, and his boot sank ankle-deep into a carpet of moss. An instant later, the gedwëy ignasia on his palm began to itch, and he heard a tiny chorus of <span class="italic">skree-skree!</span> and <span class="italic">skree-skra!</span> as a half-dozen white, wormlike grubs—each the size of one of his thumbs—burst out of the moss and began to hop away from him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Old instincts took hold, and he stopped as he would if he had chanced upon a snake. He did not blink. He did not even breathe as he watched the fat, obscene-looking grubs flee. At the same time, he racked his memory for any mention of them during his training in Ellesméra, but he could recall no such thing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Glaedr! What are these</span>? And he showed the dragon the grubs. <span class="italic">What is their name in the ancient language</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To Eragon’s dismay, Glaedr said, <span class="italic">They are unknown to me. I have not seen their like before, nor have I ever heard tell of them. They are new to Vroengard, and new to Alagaësia. Do not let them touch you; they may be more dangerous than they appear</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once they had put several feet between them and Eragon, the nameless grubs hopped higher than usual and with a <span class="italic">skree-skro!</span> dove back into the moss. As they landed, they split, dividing into a swarm of green centipedes, which quickly disappeared within the tangled strands of moss.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Only then did Eragon allow himself to breathe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">They should not be</span>, said Glaedr. He sounded troubled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon slowly lifted his boot off the moss and retreated behind the log. Examining the moss with greater care, he saw that what he had originally taken as the tips of old branches poking out of the blanket of vegetation were actually pieces of broken ribs and antlers—the remains, he thought, of one or more deer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a moment’s consideration, Eragon turned around and began <span>to</span> retrace his steps, this time making sure to avoid every scrap of moss along the way, which was no easy task.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Whatever had been chattering in the forest was not worth risking his life to find—especially since he suspected that there was worse than the grubs lurking among the trees. His palm kept itching, and from experience, he knew that meant there was still <span class="italic">something</span> dangerous close by.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he could see the meadow and the blue of Saphira’s scales between the trunks of the evergreens, he turned aside and walked to the brook. Moss covered the bank of the stream, so he stepped from log to stone until he was standing on a flat-topped rock in the midst of the water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There he squatted, removed his gloves, and washed his hands, face, and neck. The touch of the icy water was bracing, and within moments his ears flushed and his whole body began to feel warm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A loud chattering rang forth over the stream as he wiped the last few droplets from his neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Moving as little as possible, he looked toward the top of the trees on the opposite bank.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Thirty feet up, four shadows sat on a branch. The shadows had large barbed plumes that extended in every direction from the black ovals of their heads. A pair of white eyes, slanted and slit-like, glowed within the middle of each oval, and the blankness of their gaze made it impossible to determine where they were looking. Most disconcerting yet, the shadows, like all shadows, had no depth. When they turned to the side, they disappeared.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without taking his eyes off them, Eragon reached across his body and grasped Brisingr’s hilt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The leftmost shadow ruffled its plumes and then uttered the same shrieking chatter he had mistaken for a squirrel. Two more of the wraiths did likewise, and the forest echoed with the strident clamor of their cries.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon considered trying to touch their minds, but remembering <span>the</span> Fanghur on his way to Ellesméra, he discarded the idea as foolhardy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In a low voice, he said, “Eka aí fricai un Shur’tugal.” I am a Rider and a friend.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The shadows seemed to fix their glowing eyes upon him, and for a moment, all was silent, save the gentle murmuring of the brook. Then they began to chatter again, and their eyes increased in brightness until they were like pieces of white-hot iron.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When, after several minutes, the shadows had made no move to attack him and, moreover, showed no indication of departing, Eragon rose to his feet and carefully reached out with one foot toward the stone behind him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The motion seemed to alarm the wraiths; they shrieked in unison. Then they shrugged and shook themselves, and in their place appeared four large owls, with the same barbed plumes surrounding their mottled faces. They opened their yellow beaks and chattered at him, scolding him even as squirrels might; then they took wing and flew silently off into the trees and soon vanished behind a screen of heavy boughs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Barzûl,” said Eragon. He jumped back the way he had come and hurried to the meadow, stopping only to pick up an armful of fallen branches.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As soon as he reached Saphira, he placed the wood on the ground, knelt, and began to cast wards, as many as he could think of. Glaedr recommended a spell that he had overlooked, then said, <span class="italic">None of these creatures were here when Oromis and I returned after the battle. They are not as they should be. The magic that was cast here has twisted the land and those who live on it. This is an evil place now</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What creatures</span>? asked Saphira. She opened her eyes and yawned, an intimidating sight. Eragon shared his memories with her, and she said, <span class="italic">You should have brought me with you. I could have eaten the grubs and the shadow birds, and then you would have had nothing to fear from them</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Saphira!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She rolled an eye at him. <span class="italic">I’m hungry. Magic or not, is there any reason I should not eat these strange things</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Because they might eat</span> you <span class="italic">instead, Saphira Bjartskular</span>, said Glaedr. <span class="italic">You know the first law of hunting as well as I: do not stalk your prey until you are sure that it</span> is <span class="italic">prey. Otherwise, you might well end up as a meal for something else</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I wouldn’t bother looking for deer either,” said Eragon. “I doubt there are many left. Besides, it’s almost dark, and even if it weren’t, I’m not sure hunting here would be safe.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She growled softly. <span class="italic">Very well. Then I shall keep sleeping. But in the morning, I shall hunt, no matter the danger. My belly is empty, and I must eat before crossing the sea again</span>.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">True to her word, Saphira closed her eyes and promptly returned to sleep.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon built a small fire, then ate a meager supper and watched the valley grow black. He and Glaedr talked about their plans for the following day, and Glaedr told him more about the history of the island, going back to the time before the elves had arrived in Alagaësia, when Vroengard had been the province of the dragons alone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Before the last of the light had faded from the sky, the old dragon said, <span class="italic">Would you like to see Vroengard as it was during the age of the Riders</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I would</span>, said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then look</span>, said Glaedr, and Eragon felt the dragon take hold of his mind and into it pour a stream of images and sensations. Eragon’s vision shifted, and atop the landscape, he beheld a ghostly twin of the valley. The memory was of the valley in twilight, even as it was at the present, but the sky was free of clouds, and a multitude of stars shone twinkling and gleaming over the great ring of fire mountains, Aras Thelduin. The trees of long ago appeared taller, straighter, and less foreboding, and throughout the valley, the Riders’ buildings stood intact, glowing like pale beacons in the dusk <span>with</span> the soft light from the elves’ flameless lanterns. Less ivy and moss covered the ocher stone then, and the halls and towers seemed noble in a way that the ruins did not. And along the cobblestone pathways and high overhead, Eragon discerned the glittering shapes of numerous dragons: graceful giants with the treasure of a thousand kings upon their hides.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The apparition lasted for a moment longer; then Glaedr released Eragon’s mind, and the valley once more appeared as it was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It was beautiful</span>, said Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">That it was, but no more</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon continued to study the valley, comparing it to what Glaedr had shown him, and he frowned when he saw a line of bobbing lights—lanterns, he thought—within the abandoned city. He whispered a spell to sharpen his sight and was able to make out a line of hooded figures in dark robes walking slowly through the ruins. They seemed solemn and unearthly, and there was a ritualistic quality to the measured beats of their strides and to the patterned sway of their lanterns.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Who are they</span>? he asked Glaedr. He felt as if he was witnessing something not meant for others to see.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I do not know. Perhaps they are the descendants of those who hid during the battle. Perhaps they are men of your race who thought to settle here after the fall of the Riders. Or perhaps they are those who worship dragons and Riders as gods</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Are there really such</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">There were. We discouraged the practice, but even so, it was common in many of the more isolated parts of Alagaësia. … It is good, I think, that you placed the wards you did</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon watched as the hooded figures wound their way across the city, which took almost an hour. Once they arrived at the far side, the lanterns winked out one by one, and where the lantern holders had gone, Eragon could not see, even with the assistance of magic.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon banked the fire with handfuls of dirt and crawled under his blankets to rest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><img alt="figure" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre29"/></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Eragon! Saphira! Rouse yourselves!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s eyes snapped open. He sat upright and grabbed Brisingr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">All was dark, save for the dull red glow of the bed of coals to his right and a ragged patch of starry sky off to the east. Though the light was faint, Eragon was able to make out the general shape of the forest and the meadow … and the monstrously large snail that was sliding across the grass toward him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon yelped and scrambled backward. The snail—whose shell was over five and a half feet tall—hesitated, then slimed toward him as fast as a man could run. A snakelike hiss came from the black slit of its mouth, and its waving eyeballs were each the size of his fist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon realized that he would not have time to get to his feet, and on his back he did not have the space he needed to draw Brisingr. He prepared to cast a spell, but before he could, Saphira’s head arrowed past him and she caught the snail about the middle with her jaws. The snail’s shell cracked between her fangs with a sound like breaking slate, and the creature uttered a faint, quavering shriek.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a twist of her neck, Saphira tossed the snail into the air, opened her mouth as wide as it would go, and swallowed the creature whole, bobbing her head twice as she did, like a robin eating an earthworm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Lowering his gaze, Eragon saw four more giant snails farther down upon the rise. One of the creatures had retreated within its shell; the others were hurrying away upon their undulating, skirtlike bellies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Over there!” shouted Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira leaped forward. Her entire body left the ground for a moment, and then she landed upon all fours and snapped up first one, then two, then three of the snails. She did not eat the last snail, the one hiding in its shell, but drew back her head and bathed it in a stream of blue and yellow flame that lit up the land for hundreds of feet in every direction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She maintained the flame for no more than a second or two; <span>then</span> she picked up the smoking, steaming snail between her jaws—as gently as a mother cat picking up a kitten—carried it over to Eragon, and dropped it at his feet. He eyed it with distrust, but it appeared well and truly dead.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Now you can have a proper breakfast</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He stared at her, then began to laugh—and he kept laughing until he was doubled over, resting his hands on his knees and heaving for breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What is so amusing</span>? she asked, and sniffed the soot-blackened shell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, why do you laugh, Eragon</span>? asked Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He shook his head and continued to wheeze. At last he was able to say, “Because—” And then he shifted to speaking with his mind so that Glaedr would hear as well. <span class="italic">Because … snail and eggs!</span> And he began to giggle again, feeling very silly. <span class="italic">Because, snail steaks! … Hungry? Have a stalk! Feeling tired? Eat an eyeball! Who needs mead when you have slime?! I could put the stalks in a cup, like a bunch of flowers, and they would</span> … He was laughing so hard, he found it impossible to continue, and he dropped to one knee while he gasped for air, tears of mirth streaming from his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira parted her jaws in a toothy approximation of a smile, and she made a soft choking sound in her throat. <span class="italic">You are very odd sometimes, Eragon</span>. He could feel his merriment infecting her. She sniffed the shell again. <span class="italic">Some mead would be nice</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“At least you ate,” he said, both with his mind and his tongue.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Not enough, but enough to return to the Varden</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As his laughter subsided, Eragon poked at the snail with the tip of his boot. <span class="italic">It’s been so long since there were dragons on Vroengard, it must not have realized what you were and thought to make an easy meal of me. … That would have been a sorry death indeed, to end up as dinner for a snail</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">But memorable</span>, said Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">But memorable</span>, he agreed, feeling his mirth return.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And what did I say is the first law of hunting, younglings</span>? asked Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Together Eragon and Saphira replied, <span class="italic">Do not stalk your prey until you are sure that it</span> is <span class="italic">prey</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Very good</span>, said Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon said, <span class="italic">Hopping grubs, shadow birds, and now giant snails … How could the spells cast within the battle have created them</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">The Riders, the dragons, and the Forsworn loosed an enormous amount of energy during the conflict. Much of it was bound in spells, but much of it was not. Those who lived to tell of it said that, for a time, the world went mad and nothing they saw or heard could be trusted. Some of that energy must have settled on the ancestors of the grubs and the birds you saw today and altered them. However, you are mistaken to include the snails among their ranks. The snalglí, as they are known, have always lived here on Vroengard. They were a favorite food of ours, of the dragons, for reasons I’m sure, Saphira, you understand</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She hummed and licked her chops.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And not only is their flesh soft and tasty, but the shells are good for the digestion</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If they’re just ordinary animals, then why didn’t my wards stop them</span>? asked Eragon. <span class="italic">At the very least, I should have been warned of approaching danger</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">That</span>, replied Glaedr, <span class="italic">may be a result of the battle. Magic did not create the snalglí, but that does not mean they have remained unaffected by the forces that have wracked this place. We should not linger here any longer than necessary. Better we leave before whatever else is lurking on the island decides to test our mettle</span>.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">With Saphira’s help, Eragon cracked open the shell of the burnt snail and, by the glow of a red werelight, cleaned the spineless carcass within, which was a messy, slimy exercise that left him covered in gore up to his elbows. Then Eragon had Saphira bury the meat close to the bed of coals.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Afterward, Saphira returned to the spot in the grass where she had been lying, curled up once again, and went to sleep. This time Eragon joined her. Carrying his blankets and the saddlebags, one of which contained Glaedr’s heart of hearts, he crawled under her wing and settled in the warm, dark nook between her neck and her body. And there he spent the rest of the night, thinking and dreaming.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">The following day was as gray and gloomy as the previous one. A light dusting of snow covered the sides of the mountains and the tops of the foothills, and the air had a chill that led Eragon to believe it would snow again later that day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Tired as she was, Saphira did not stir until the sun was already a handsbreadth above the mountains. Eragon was impatient, but he let her sleep. It was more important for her to recover from the flight to Vroengard than for them to get an early start.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once she was awake, Saphira dug up the snail carcass for him, and he cooked a large breakfast of snail … he was not sure what to call it: snail bacon? Whatever the name for it, the strips of meat were delicious, and he ate more than he usually would. Saphira devoured what was left, and then they waited an hour, for it would not be wise to enter a fight with food in their stomachs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Finally, Eragon rolled up his blankets and strapped the saddle back onto Saphira, and together with Glaedr they set off for the Rock of Kuthian.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_112"></div></body>
