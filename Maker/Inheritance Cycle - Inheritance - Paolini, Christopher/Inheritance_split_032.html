<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">THE NEXT THREE</span></span> days passed quickly for Eragon, if not for the rest of the Varden, who remained mired in lethargy. The standoff with Dras-Leona continued unabated, although there was some excitement when Thorn altered his customary location from above the front gates to a section of the rampart several hundred feet to the right. After much discussion—and after consulting extensively with Saphira—Nasuada and her advisers concluded that Thorn had relocated for no other reason than comfort; the other section of rampart was somewhat flatter and longer. Aside from that, the siege lumbered on without change.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Meanwhile, Eragon spent the mornings and evenings studying with Glaedr and the afternoons sparring with Arya and several other elves. His matches with the elves were not as long or strenuous as his previous one with Arya—for it would have been foolish to push himself that hard every day—but his sessions with Glaedr were as intense as ever. The ancient dragon never flagged in his efforts to improve Eragon’s skills and knowledge, and he made no allowances for mistakes or exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was pleased to find that he was finally able to hold his own when dueling with the elves. But it was mentally taxing, for if his concentration lapsed for even a moment, he would end up with a sword jabbed in his ribs or pressed against his throat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With his lessons from Glaedr, he made what would have been considered exemplary progress under normal circumstances, but given the situation, both he and Glaedr were frustrated with the pace of his learning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">On the second day, during his morning lesson with Glaedr, <span>Eragon</span> thought to say, <span class="italic">Master, when I first arrived at the Varden in Farthen Dûr, the Twins tested me—they tested my knowledge of the ancient language, and of magic in general</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">You told this to Oromis. Why repeat it to me now</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Because, it occurred to me … the Twins asked me to summon the true form of a silver ring. At the time, I didn’t know how. Arya explained it to me later: how, with the ancient language, you can conjure up the essence of any thing or creature. Yet Oromis never spoke of it, and I was wondering … why not</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Glaedr seemed to sigh. <span class="italic">Summoning the true form of an object is a difficult kind of magic. In order for it to work, you must understand everything of importance about the object in question—even as you must in order to guess the true name of a person or animal. Furthermore, it’s of little practical value. And it’s dangerous. Very dangerous. The spell cannot be structured as a continuing process that you can end at any time. Either you succeed in summoning the true form of an object … or you fail and die. There was no reason for Oromis to have you try anything so risky, nor were you advanced enough in your studies to even discuss the topic</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shuddered inwardly as he realized just how angry Arya must have been with the Twins to summon the true form of the ring they held. Then he said, <span class="italic">I would like to try it now</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon felt the full force of Glaedr’s attention focused on him. <span class="italic">Why</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I need to know if I have that level of understanding, even if only for one small thing</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Again: why</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Unable to explain with words, Eragon poured his jumble of thoughts and feelings into Glaedr’s consciousness. When he finished, Glaedr was silent for a while, digesting the flow of information. <span class="italic">Am I right to say</span>, began the dragon, <span class="italic">that you equate this with defeating Galbatorix? You believe that if you can do this and live, then you might be able to defeat the king</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes</span>, said Eragon, relieved. He had been unable to articulate his motivation as clearly as the dragon, but that was exactly it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And are you determined to try this</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, Master</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">It may kill you</span>, Glaedr reminded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I know</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Eragon!</span> exclaimed Saphira, her thoughts faint in his mind. She was flying high above the camp, watching for possible danger while he studied with Glaedr. <span class="italic">It’s far too dangerous. I won’t allow it</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I have to do this</span>, he replied quietly.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To Saphira, but also to Eragon, Glaedr said, <span class="italic">If he insists, then it is best he tries where I can watch. If his knowledge fails him, I may be able to supply the needed information and save him</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira growled—an angry, ripping sound that filled Eragon’s mind—and then, from outside the tent, Eragon heard a fearsome rush of air and startled cries from men and elves as she dove to the ground. She landed with such force, the tent and everything in it shook.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A few seconds later, she stuck her head into the tent and glared at Eragon. She was panting, and the wind from her nostrils ruffled his hair and made his eyes water from the odor of burnt meat. <span class="italic">You’re as thick-headed as a Kull</span>, she said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No more than you</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her lip curled in a hint of a snarl. <span class="italic">Why are we waiting? If you must do this, let us be done with it!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">What will you choose to summon</span>? asked Glaedr. <span class="italic">It must be something you are intimately familiar with</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon let his gaze drift over the interior of the tent, then down to the sapphire ring he wore on his right hand. <span class="italic">Aren</span> …He had rarely taken the ring off since Ajihad had given it to him from Brom. It had become a part of his body as surely as his arms or legs. During the hours he had spent looking at it, he had memorized every curve and facet, and if he closed his eyes, he could call up an image that was a perfect reproduction of the actual object. But for all that, there was much he did <span class="italic">not</span> know about the ring—its history, how the elves had made it, and, ultimately, what spells might or might not be woven into its fabric.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">No … not Aren</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then his gaze slid from the ring to the pommel of Brisingr, where the sword stood leaning against the corner of his cot. “Brisingr,” he murmured.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A muffled <span class="italic">whump</span> emanated from the blade, and the sword rose a half inch out of its scabbard, as if pushed from beneath, and small tongues of flame leaped up from the mouth of the sheath, licking the underside of the hilt. The flames vanished and the sword slid back into the scabbard as Eragon quickly ended the unintentional spell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Brisingr</span>, he thought, utterly certain of his choice. It had been Rhunön’s skill that had crafted the sword, but it was he who had wielded the tools, and he had been joined with the elf smith’s mind throughout the process. If there was any one object in the world he understood through and through, it was his sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Are you sure</span>? asked Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded, then caught himself as he remembered the golden dragon could not see him. Y<span class="italic">es, Master. … A question, though: is</span> Brisingr <span class="italic">the true name of the sword, and if not, do I need its true name for the spell to work</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Brisingr <span class="italic">is the name of fire, as you well know. The true name of your sword is undoubtedly something far more complicated, although it might very well include</span> brisingr <span class="italic">within its description. If you wish, you could refer to the sword by its true name, but you could just as easily call it</span> Sword <span class="italic">and achieve the same result, so long as you maintain the proper knowledge at the forefront of your mind. The name is merely a label for the knowledge, and you do not need the label in order to make use of the knowledge. It is a subtle distinction, but an important one. Do you understand</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I do</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then proceed as you will</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon took a moment to collect himself. Then he found the nub in the back of his mind and reached through it to tap his body’s store of energy. Channeling that energy into the word he spoke, <span>while</span> also thinking about everything he knew of the sword, he said clearly and distinctly:</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Brisingr!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon felt his strength ebb precipitously. Alarmed, he tried to speak, tried to move, but the spell bound him in place. He could not even blink or breathe.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Unlike before, the sheathed sword did not burst into flame; it wavered, like a reflection in water. Then, in the air next to the weapon, a transparent apparition appeared: a perfect, glowing likeness of Brisingr free of its sheath. As well made as was the sword itself—and Eragon had never found so much as a single flaw—the duplicate floating before him was even more refined. It was as if he was seeing the <span class="italic">idea</span> of the sword, an idea that not even Rhunön, with all her experience working metal, could hope to capture.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As soon as the manifestation became visible, Eragon was again able to breathe and move. He maintained the spell for several seconds, so he could marvel at the beauty of the summoning, and then he let the spell slip free of his grasp and the ghostly sword slowly faded into oblivion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In its absence, the inside of the tent seemed unexpectedly dark.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Only then did Eragon again become aware of Saphira and Glaedr pressing against his consciousness, watching with steadfast attentiveness every thought that flickered through his mind. Both of the dragons were as tense as Eragon had ever felt them. If he were to poke Saphira, he guessed she would be so startled, she would twist herself in circles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">And if I were to poke you, nothing would be left but a smear</span>, she commented.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon smiled and lowered himself onto the cot, tired.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In his mind, Eragon heard a sound like wind rushing across a lonely plain as Glaedr relaxed. <span class="italic">You did well, Shadeslayer</span>. Glaedr’s praise surprised Eragon; the old dragon had given out few enough compliments since he had begun teaching Eragon. <span class="italic">But let us not try it again</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shivered and rubbed his arms, trying to dispel the cold that had crept into his limbs. <span class="italic">Agreed, Master</span>. It was not an experience he was eager to replicate. Still, he felt a deep sense of satisfaction. He had proven without a doubt that there was at least one thing in Alagaësia that he could do as well as anyone possibly could.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">And that gave him hope.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">On the morning of the third day, Roran arrived back at the Varden, along with his companions: tired, wounded, and travel-worn. Roran’s return stirred the Varden from their torpor for a few hours—he and the others with him were given a hero’s welcome—but an air of boredom soon settled over the majority of the Varden again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was relieved to see Roran. He had known his cousin was safe, as he had scryed him several times while he was gone. Nevertheless, seeing him in person freed Eragon of an anxiety that, until that very moment, he had not realized he was carrying. Roran was the only family he had left—Murtagh did not count, as far as Eragon was concerned—and Eragon could not bear the thought of losing him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Now, seeing Roran up close, Eragon was shocked by his appearance. He had expected Roran and the others to be exhausted, but Roran seemed far more haggard than his companions; he looked as if he had aged five years over the course of the trip. His eyes were red and dark-ringed, his brow was lined, and he moved stiffly, as if every inch of his body was covered in bruises. And then there was his beard, which had been burned half off and which now had a mottled, mangy appearance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The five men—one less than their original number—went first to visit the healers of Du Vrangr Gata, where the spellcasters attended to their wounds. Then they presented themselves to Nasuada in her pavilion. After commending them for their bravery, Nasuada dismissed all of the men except Roran, whom she asked to deliver a detailed account of his journey to and from Aroughs, as well as the capture of the city itself. The telling took some time, but <span>both</span> Nasuada and Eragon—who was standing by her right hand—listened with rapt and sometimes horrified attention while Roran spoke. When he finished, Nasuada surprised both him and Eragon by announcing that she was placing Roran in charge of one of the Varden’s battalions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon expected the news to please Roran. Instead, he saw the lines in his cousin’s face deepen and his brows draw together in a frown. Roran made no objection or complaint, however, but bowed and said in his rough voice, “As you wish, Lady Nasuada.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Later, Eragon walked Roran to his tent, where Katrina was waiting for them. She greeted Roran with such an obvious display of emotion that Eragon averted his eyes, embarrassed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With Saphira, the three of them dined together, but Eragon and Saphira excused themselves as soon as they could, for it was obvious that Roran had no energy for company and Katrina wished to have him for herself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he and Saphira wandered through the camp in the deepening dusk, Eragon heard someone behind him shout, “Eragon! Eragon! Wait a moment!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He turned to see the thin, gangly figure of the scholar Jeod running toward him, strands of hair flying around his lean face. In his left hand, Jeod clutched a ragged scrap of parchment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What is it?” Eragon asked, worried.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This!” exclaimed Jeod, his eyes gleaming. He held up the parchment and shook it. “I’ve done it again, Eragon! I’ve found a way!” In the fading light, the scar on his scalp and temple appeared startlingly pale against his tanned skin.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’ve done <span class="italic">what</span> again? You’ve found <span class="italic">what</span> way? Slow down; you’re not making sense!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Jeod glanced around furtively, then he leaned close to Eragon and whispered, “All my reading and searching has paid off. I’ve discovered a hidden tunnel that leads straight into Dras-Leona!”</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_63"></div></body>
