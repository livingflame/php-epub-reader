<span class="calibre12"><span class="calibre26">INTO THE</span></span> M<span class="calibre12"><span class="calibre26">AW</span></span></span></h2><div class="calibre3"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">“MUST YOU DO</span></span> that?” asked Elva.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon paused in the midst of checking the leg straps on Saphira’s saddle and looked over to where the girl sat cross-legged on the grass, toying with the links of her mail shirt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She tapped her lip with a small, pointed fingernail. “You keep chewing on the inside of your mouth. It’s distracting.” After a moment’s consideration, she said, “And disgusting.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With some surprise, he realized that he had bitten the inner surface of his right cheek until it was covered with several bloody sores. “Sorry,” he said, and healed himself with a quick spell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He had spent the deepest part of the night meditating—thinking not of what was to come nor of what had been, but only of what was: the touch of the cool air against his skin, the feel of the ground beneath him, the steady flow of his breath, and the slow beat of his heart as it marked off the remaining moments of his life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Now, however, the morning star, Aiedail, had risen in the east—heralding the arrival of dawn’s first light—and the time had come to ready themselves for battle. He had inspected every inch of his equipment, adjusted the harness of the saddle until it was perfectly comfortable for Saphira, emptied the saddlebags of everything but the chest that contained Glaedr’s Eldunarí and a blanket for padding, and buckled and rebuckled his sword belt at least five times.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He finished examining the straps on the saddle, then jumped off Saphira. “Stand up,” he said. Elva gave him a look of annoyance but <span>did</span> as he asked, brushing grass from the side of her tunic. Moving quickly, he ran his hands over her thin shoulders and tugged on the edge of her mail hauberk to ensure that it was sitting properly. “Who made this for you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“A pair of charming dwarf brothers called Ûmar and Ulmar.” Her cheeks dimpled as she smiled at him. “They didn’t think I needed it, but I was <span class="italic">very</span> persuasive.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I’m sure she was</span>, Saphira said to Eragon. He suppressed a smile. The girl had spent a goodly portion of the night talking with the dragons, beguiling them as only she could. However, Eragon could tell that they also feared her—even the older ones, such as Valdr—for they had no defense against Elva’s power. No one did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And did Ûmar and Ulmar give you a blade to fight with?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elva frowned. “Why would I want that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He stared at her for a moment, then he fetched his old hunting knife, which he used when eating, and had her tie it around her waist with a leather thong. “Just in case,” he said when she protested. “Now, up you go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She obediently climbed onto his back and locked her arms around his neck. He had carried her to the hill in that manner, which had been uncomfortable for them both, but she could not keep pace with him on foot.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He carefully climbed up Saphira’s side to the peak of her shoulders. As he clung to one of the spikes that protruded from her neck, he twisted his body so that Elva was able to pull herself into the saddle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once he felt the girl’s weight leave him, Eragon dropped back to the ground. He tossed his shield up to her, then lunged forward, arms outstretched, when it nearly pulled her off Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Have you got it?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes,” she said, tugging the shield onto her lap. She made a shooing motion with one hand. “Go, go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Holding Brisingr’s pommel to keep the sword from tangling <span>between</span> his legs, Eragon ran to the top of the hill and knelt on one knee, staying as low as he could. Behind him, Saphira crawled partway up the rise, then pressed herself flat against the ground and snaked her head through the grass until it was next to him and she could see what he saw.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A thick column of humans, dwarves, elves, Urgals, and werecats streamed out of the Varden’s camp. In the flat gray light of early dawn, the figures were difficult to make out, especially because they carried no lights. The column marched across the sloping fields toward Urû’baen, and when the warriors were about half a mile from the city, they divided into three lines. One positioned itself before the front gate, one turned toward the southeastern part of the curtain wall, and one went toward the northwestern part.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was the last group that Eragon had hinted he and Saphira were going to accompany.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The warriors had wrapped rags around their feet and weapons, and they kept their voices to a whisper. Still, Eragon could hear the occasional bray of a donkey or the whinny of a horse, and a number of dogs were barking at the procession. The soldiers on the walls would soon notice the activity—most likely when the warriors began to move the catapults, ballistae, and siege towers that the Varden had already assembled and placed in the fields before the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon was impressed that the men, dwarves, and Urgals were still willing to go into battle after seeing Shruikan. <span class="italic">They must have a great deal of faith in us</span>, he said to Saphira. The responsibility weighed heavily upon him, and he was keenly aware that if he and those with him failed, few of the warriors would survive.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Yes, but if Shruikan flies out again, they will scatter like so many frightened mice</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Then we’d best not let that happen</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A horn sounded in Urû’baen, and then another and another, and lights began to appear throughout the city as lanterns were unshuttered and torches lit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Here we go,” Eragon murmured, his pulse quickening.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Now that the alarm had been raised, the Varden abandoned all attempts at secrecy. To the east, a group of elves on horseback set off at a gallop toward the hill that backed the city, planning to ride up the side of it and attack the wall along the top of the immense shelf that hung over Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the center of the Varden’s mostly empty camp, Eragon saw what appeared to be Saphira’s glittering shape. On the illusion sat a lone figure—which he knew bore a perfect copy of his own features—holding a sword and shield.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The duplicate of Saphira raised her head and spread her wings; then she took flight and loosed a stirring roar.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">They do a good job of it, don’t they</span>? he said to Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Elves understand how a dragon is supposed to look and behave … unlike some humans</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The shadow-Saphira landed next to the northernmost group of warriors, although Eragon noticed the elves were careful to keep her some distance from the men and dwarves, so that they would not brush up against her and discover that she was as insubstantial as a rainbow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sky lightened as the Varden and their allies gathered in orderly formations at each of the three locations outside the walls. Inside the city, Galbatorix’s soldiers continued to prepare for the assault, but it was obvious as they ran about the battlements that they were panicked and disorganized. However, Eragon knew their confusion would not last long.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Now</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">Now! Don’t wait any longer</span>. He swept his gaze over the buildings, searching for the slightest scrap of red, but none met his eye. <span class="italic">Where are you, blast it?! Show yourself!</span></span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Three more horns sounded, this time the Varden’s. A great chorus of shouts and cries rose from the army, and then the Varden’s war machines launched their projectiles at the city, archers loosed their arrows, and the ranks of warriors broke and charged toward the seemingly impenetrable curtain wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The stones, javelins, and arrows appeared to move slowly as they arced across the ground that separated the army from the city. None of the missiles hit the outer wall; it would be pointless to try to batter it down, so the engineers aimed above and beyond. Some of the stones shattered as they struck within Urû’baen, sending dagger-like shards in every direction, while others punched through buildings and bounced up the streets like giant marbles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon thought how horrible it would be to wake amid such confusion, with large chunks of stone raining down. Then activity elsewhere caught his attention as the shadow-Saphira took flight over the running warriors. With three flaps of her wings, she climbed above the wall and bathed the battlements with a tongue of flame that, to Eragon’s eye, appeared somewhat brighter than normal. The fire, he knew, was real enough, conjured into being by the elves close to the northern part of the wall, who had created and were sustaining the illusion.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The apparition of Saphira swooped back and forth over the same stretch of wall, clearing it of soldiers. Once she had, a band of twenty-some elves flew from the ground outside the city up to the top of one of the wall towers, so they could continue to keep watch on the apparition as it ranged deeper into Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">If Murtagh and Thorn don’t show themselves soon, they’re going to start wondering why we’re not attacking the other parts of the wall</span>, he said to Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">They will think we’re defending the warriors trying to breach this section</span>, she replied. <span class="italic">Give it time</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elsewhere along the wall, soldiers fired arrows and javelins at the army below, felling dozens of the Varden. The deaths were unavoidable, but Eragon regretted them all the same, for the warriors’ attacks were merely a distraction; they had little chance of actually surmounting the city’s defenses. Meanwhile, the siege towers trundled closer, and flights of arrows leaped between their upper levels and the men on the battlements.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From above, a ribbon of burning pitch fell across the edge of <span>the</span> overhang and disappeared among the buildings below. Eragon looked up and saw flashes of light atop the wall that guarded the lip of the precipice. Even as he watched, he saw four bodies tumble over the side; they looked like understuffed dolls as they plummeted toward the ground. The sight pleased Eragon, for it meant the elves had taken the upper wall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The shadow-Saphira looped over the city, lighting several buildings on fire. As she did, a flock of arrows shot up from archers stationed on a nearby rooftop. The apparition swerved to avoid the darts and, seemingly by accident, crashed into one of the six green elf towers scattered throughout Urû’baen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The collision looked perfectly real. Eragon winced with sympathy as he saw the dragon’s left wing break against the tower, the bones snapping like stalks of dry grass. The imitation Saphira roared and thrashed as she spiraled down to the streets. The buildings hid her after that, but her roars were audible for miles around, and the flame she seemed to breathe painted the sides of the houses and lit the underside of the stone shelf that hung over the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I would never have been so clumsy</span>, sniffed Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I know</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A minute passed. The tension within Eragon increased to a nearly unbearable level. “Where are they?” he growled, clenching his fist. With every passing second, it became increasingly likely the soldiers would discover that the dragon they thought they had forced down did not actually exist.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira saw them first. <span class="italic">There</span>, she said, showing him with her mind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Like a ruby blade dropped from above, Thorn plunged out of an opening hidden within the overhang. He fell straight down for several hundred feet, then unfolded his wings just enough to slow himself to a safe speed before landing in a square close to where the shadow-Saphira and the shadow-Eragon had fallen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon thought he spotted Murtagh on the red dragon, but the distance was too great to be sure. They would have to hope it was <span>Murtagh</span>, because if it was Galbatorix, their plan was almost certainly doomed to failure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">There must be tunnels in the stone</span>, he said to Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">More dragon fire erupted from between the buildings; then the apparition of Saphira hopped above the rooftops and, like a bird with an injured wing, fluttered a short distance before sinking to the ground again. Thorn followed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon did not wait to see more.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He spun around, ran back along Saphira’s neck, and threw himself into the saddle behind Elva. It took just a few seconds to slip his legs into the straps and tighten two on each side. He left the rest loose; they would only slow him later. The uppermost strap held Elva’s legs also.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Swiftly chanting the words, he cast a spell to hide the three of them. When the magic took effect, he experienced the usual sense of disorientation as his body vanished. It looked to him as if he were hanging a number of feet above a dark, dragon-shaped pattern pressed into the plants of the hill.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The moment he finished the spell, Saphira surged forward. She jumped off the crest of the hill and flapped hard, struggling to gain height.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s not very comfortable, is it?” said Elva as Eragon took his shield from her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, not always!” he replied, raising his voice to be heard over the wind.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the back of his mind, he could feel Glaedr and Umaroth and the other Eldunarí watching as Saphira angled downward and dove toward the Varden’s camp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Now we will have our revenge</span>, said Glaedr.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hunched low over Elva as Saphira gained speed. Gathered in the center of the camp, he saw Blödhgarm and his ten elven spellcasters, as well as Arya—who carried the Dauthdaert. They each had a thirty-foot-long piece of rope tied around their chests, <span>under</span> their arms. At the other end, all the ropes were bound to a log as thick as Eragon’s thigh and equal in length to a fully grown Urgal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Saphira swooped toward the camp, Eragon signaled them with his mind and two of the elves threw the log into the air. Saphira caught it with her talons, the elves jumped, and a moment later, Eragon felt a jolt and Saphira dipped as she took up their weight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Through her body, Eragon saw the elves, the ropes, and the log wink out of sight as the elves cast a spell of invisibility, the same as he had.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Flapping mightily, Saphira climbed a thousand feet above the ground, high enough that she and the elves below could easily clear the walls and buildings of the city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To their left, Eragon glimpsed first Thorn and then the shadow-Saphira as they chased each other on foot through the northern part of the city. The elves controlling the apparition were trying to keep Thorn and Murtagh so busy physically that neither of them would have the opportunity to attack with their minds. If they did, or if they caught the apparition, they would quickly realize they had been fooled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Just a few more minutes</span>, Eragon thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Over the fields flew Saphira. Over the catapults with their devoted attendants. Over banks of archers with their arrows stuck in the ground in front of them, like tufts of white-topped reeds. Over a siege tower, and over the warriors on foot: men, dwarves, and Urgals hiding beneath their shields as they rushed ladders toward the curtain wall, and among them elves: tall and slender, with their bright helms and their long-bladed spears and narrow-bladed swords.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Saphira soared past the wall itself. Eragon felt a strange twinge as Saphira reappeared beneath him, and he found himself looking at the back of Elva’s head. He assumed that Arya and the other elves hanging below them had become visible as well. Eragon bit off a curse and ended the spell that had concealed them. Galbatorix’s wards, it seemed, would not allow them to enter the city unseen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira hastened her flight toward the citadel’s massive gate. <span>Below</span> them, Eragon heard shouts of fear and astonishment, but he paid them no heed. Murtagh and Thorn were the ones he was worried about, not the soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Bringing in her wings, Saphira dove toward the gate. Just when it looked as if she was going to slam into it, she turned and reared upright while back-flapping to slow herself. When she had reached a near stop, she allowed herself to drift downward until the elves were safely on the ground.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once they had cut themselves free of the ropes and moved out of the way, Saphira landed in the courtyard before the gate, jarring both Eragon and Elva with the force of the impact.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon yanked on the buckles of the straps that held him and Elva in the saddle. Then he helped the girl down from Saphira’s back and they hurried after the elves toward the gate.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The entrance to the citadel took the form of two giant black doors, which met in a point high above. They looked to be made of solid iron and were studded with hundreds, if not thousands, of spiked rivets, each the size of Eragon’s head. The sight was daunting; Eragon could not imagine a less inviting entrance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Spear in hand, Arya ran to the sally port set within the left-hand door. The port was visible only as a thin, dark seam that outlined a rectangle barely wide enough for a single man to pass through. Within the rectangle was a horizontal strip of metal, perhaps three fingers wide and thrice as long, that was slightly lighter than its surroundings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Arya neared the door, the strip sank inward a half inch, then slid to the side with a rusty scrape. A pair of owlish eyes peered out of the dark interior.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Who are you, then?” demanded a haughty voice. “State your business or be gone!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without hesitation, Arya jabbed the Dauthdaert through the open slot. A gurgle emanated from within; then Eragon heard the sound of a body falling to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya pulled the lance back and shook the blood and scraps <span>of</span> flesh from the barbed blade. Then she grasped the haft of the weapon with both hands, placed the tip of it along the right seam of the sally port, and said, “Verma!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon squinted and turned aside as a fierce blue flame appeared between the lance and the gate. Even from several feet away, he could feel the heat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her face contorted with strain, Arya pressed the blade of the spear into the gate, slowly cutting through the iron. Sparks and drops of molten metal poured out from underneath the blade and skittered across the paved ground like grease on a hot pan, causing Eragon and the others to step back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As she worked, Eragon glanced in the direction of Thorn and the shadow-Saphira. He could not see them, but he could still hear roars and the crash of breaking masonry.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elva sagged against him, and he looked down to see that she was shaking and sweating, as if she had a fever. He knelt next to her. “Do you want me to carry you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She shook her head. “I’ll be better once we’re inside and away from … that.” She motioned in the direction of the battle.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At the edges of the courtyard, Eragon saw a number of people—they did not look like soldiers—standing in the spaces between the grand houses, watching what they were doing. <span class="italic">Scare them off, would you</span>? he asked Saphira. She swung her head around and gave a low growl, and the onlookers scurried away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When the fountain of sparks and white-hot metal ceased, Arya kicked at the sally port until—on the third kick—the door fell inward and landed on the body of the gatekeeper. A second later, the smell of burning wool and skin wafted out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Still holding the Dauthdaert, Arya stepped through the dark portal. Eragon held his breath. Whatever wards Galbatorix had placed on the citadel, the Dauthdaert ought to allow her to pass through them without harm, even as it had allowed her to cut open the sally port. But there was always a chance that the king had cast a spell the Dauthdaert would be unable to counter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">To his relief, nothing happened as Arya entered the citadel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then a group of twenty soldiers rushed toward her, pikes outstretched. Eragon drew Brisingr and ran to the sally port, but he dared not cross the threshold of the citadel to join her, not yet.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Wielding the spear with the same proficiency as her sword, Arya fought her way through the men, dispatching them with impressive speed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Why didn’t you warn her?” exclaimed Eragon, never taking his eyes off the fight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Elva joined him by the hole in the gate. “Because they won’t hurt her.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her words proved prophetic; none of the soldiers managed to land a blow. The last two men tried to flee, but Arya bounded after them and slew them before they had gone more than a dozen yards down the immense hallway, which was even larger than the four main corridors of Tronjheim.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When all of the soldiers were dead, Arya pulled the bodies aside so that there was a clear path to the sally port. Then she walked down the hallway a good forty feet, placed the Dauthdaert on the floor, and slid it back out to Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As her hand left the spear, she tensed as if in preparation for a blow, but she seemed to remain unaffected by whatever magics were in the area.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you feel anything?” Eragon called. His voice echoed in the interior of the hall.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She shook her head. “As long as we stay clear of the gate, we should be fine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon handed the spear to Blödhgarm, who took it and entered through the sally port. Together Arya and the fur-covered elf went into the rooms on either side of the gate and worked the hidden mechanisms to open it, a task that would have been beyond the same number of humans.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The clanking of chains filled the air as the giant iron doors slowly swung outward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once the gap was wide enough for Saphira, Eragon shouted, “Stop!” and the doors ground to a halt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Blödhgarm emerged from the room to the right and—keeping a safe distance from the threshold—slid the Dauthdaert to another of the elves.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In that fashion, they entered the citadel one by one.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When only Eragon, Elva, and Saphira remained outside, a terrible roar sounded in the northern part of the city, and for a moment, the whole of Urû’baen fell silent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“They have discovered our deception,” cried the elf Uthinarë. He tossed the spear to Eragon. “Hurry, Argetlam!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You next,” said Eragon, handing the Dauthdaert to Elva.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Cradling it in the crooks of her arms, she scurried over to join the elves, then pushed the spear back to Eragon, who grabbed it and ran across the threshold. Turning, he was alarmed to see Thorn rise above the buildings by the far edge of the city. Eragon dropped to one knee, placed the Dauthdaert on the floor, and rolled it to Saphira. “Quickly!” he shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A number of seconds were lost as Saphira fumbled with the lance, struggling to pick it up between the tips of her jaws. At last she got it between her teeth, and she leaped into the gigantic corridor, scattering the bodies of the soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In the distance, Thorn bellowed and flapped furiously, racing toward the citadel.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Speaking in unison, Arya and Blödhgarm cast a spell. A deafening clatter sounded within the stone walls, and the iron doors swung shut many times faster than they had opened. They closed with a <span class="italic">boom</span> that Eragon felt through his feet, and then a metal bar—three feet thick and six feet wide—slid out of each wall and through brackets bolted to the inside of the doors, securing them in place.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That should hold them for a while,” said Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not for that long,” said Eragon, looking at the open sally port.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then they turned to see what lay before them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The hallway ran for what Eragon guessed was close to a quarter <span>mile</span>, which would take them deep inside the hill behind Urû’baen. At the far end was another set of doors, just as large as the first but covered in patterned gold that glowed beautifully in the light of the flameless lanterns mounted at regular intervals along the walls. Dozens of smaller passageways branched off to either side, but none were large enough for Shruikan, although Saphira could have fit in many of them. Red banners embroidered with the outline of the twisting flame that Galbatorix used as his sigil hung along the walls every hundred feet. Otherwise, the hall was bare.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sheer size of the passageway was intimidating, and its emptiness made Eragon that much more nervous. He assumed the throne room was on the other side of the golden doors, but he did not think it would be as easy to reach as it appeared. If Galbatorix was even half as cunning as his reputation implied, he would have littered the corridor with dozens, if not hundreds, of traps.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon found it puzzling that the king had not already attacked them. He did not feel the touch of any mind save those of Saphira and his companions, but he remained acutely aware of how close they were to the king. The entire citadel seemed to be watching them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He must know we’re here,” he said. “<span class="italic">All</span> of us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then we had best make haste,” said Arya. She took the Dauthdaert from Saphira’s mouth. The weapon was covered in saliva. “Thurra,” said Arya, and the slime fell to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind them, outside the iron gate, there was a loud crash as Thorn landed in the courtyard. He uttered a roar of frustration, then something heavy struck the gate, and the walls rang with the noise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Arya trotted to the front of their group, and Elva joined her. The dark-haired girl placed a hand on the shaft of the spear—so that she too shared its protective powers—and the two of them started forward, leading the way down the long hall as they hurried ever deeper into Galbatorix’s lair.</span></p>
