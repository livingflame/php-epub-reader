<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">ERAGON GROANED AND</span></span> leaned back against Saphira. Bracing his hands on his knees, he slid down over her bumpy scales until he was sitting on the ground, then stretched out his legs in front of him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m hungry!” he exclaimed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He and Saphira were in the courtyard of the castle, away from the men who were laboring to clear it—piling stones and bodies alike into carts—and from the people streaming in and out of the damaged building, many of whom had been present at Nasuada’s audience with King Halfpaw and were now leaving to attend to other duties. Blödhgarm and four elves stood nearby, watching for danger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oi!” someone shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon looked up to see Roran walking toward him from the keep. Angela trailed a few steps behind, yarn flapping in the air as she half ran to keep up with his longer stride.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Where are you off to now?” Eragon asked as Roran stopped before him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“To help secure the city and organize the prisoners.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah …” Eragon’s gaze wondered across the busy courtyard before returning to Roran’s bruised face. “You fought well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shifted his attention to Angela, who was once again knitting, her fingers moving so quickly, he could not follow what she was doing. “<span class="italic">Cheep cheep</span>?” he asked.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">An impish expression overtook her face, and she shook her head, her voluminous curls bouncing. “A story for another time.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon accepted her evasion without complaint; he had not expected her to explain herself. She rarely did.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And you,” said Roran, “where are you going?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">We’re going to get some food</span>, said Saphira, and nudged Eragon with her snout, her breath warm on him as she exhaled.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran nodded. “That sounds best. I’ll see you at camp this evening, then.” As he turned to leave, he added, “Give my love to Katrina.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Angela tucked her knitting into a quilted bag that hung at her waist. “I guess I’ll be off as well. I have a potion brewing in my tent that I must attend to, and there’s a certain werecat I want to track down.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Grimrr?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, no—an old friend of mine: Solembum’s mother. If she’s still alive, that is. I hope she is.” She raised her hand to her brow, thumb and forefinger touching in a circle, and, in an overly cheerful voice, said, “Be seeing you!” And with that, she sailed off.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">On my back</span>, said Saphira, and rose to her feet, leaving Eragon without support.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He climbed into the saddle at the base of her neck, and Saphira unfolded her massive wings with the soft, dry sound of skin sliding over skin. The motion created a gust of near-silent wind that spread out like ripples in a pond. Throughout the courtyard, people paused to look at her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Saphira lifted her wings overhead, Eragon could see the web of purplish veins that pulsed therein, each one becoming a hollow worm track as the flow of blood subsided between the beats of her mighty heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then with a surge and a jolt, the world tilted crazily around Eragon as Saphira jumped from the courtyard to the top of the castle wall, where she balanced for a moment on the merlons, the stones cracking between the points of her claws. He grabbed the neck spike in front of him to steady himself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The world tilted again as Saphira launched herself off the wall. <span>An</span> acrid taste and smell assaulted Eragon, and his eyes smarted as Saphira passed through the thick layer of smoke that hung over Belatona like a blanket of hurt, anger, and sorrow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira flapped twice, hard, and then they emerged from the smoke into the sunshine and soared over the fire-dotted streets of the city. Stilling her wings, Saphira glided in circles, allowing the warm air from below to lift her ever higher.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Tired as he was, Eragon savored the magnificence of the view: the growling storm that was about to swallow the whole of Belatona glowed white and brilliant along its leading edge, while farther away, the thunderhead wallowed in inky shadows that betrayed nothing of their contents, save when bolts of lightning shot through them. Elsewhere the gleaming lake and the hundreds of small, verdant farms that were scattered across the landscape also commanded his attention, but none were so impressive as the mountain of clouds.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As always, Eragon felt privileged to be able to look upon the world from so high above, for he was aware of how few people had ever had the chance to fly on a dragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a slight shift of her wings, Saphira began to glide down toward the rows of gray tents that composed the Varden’s camp.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A strong wind sprang up from the west, heralding the imminent arrival of the storm. Eragon hunched over and wrapped his hands even more securely around the spike on her neck. He saw glossy ripples race across the fields below as the stalks bent under the force of the rising gale. The shifting grass reminded him of the fur of a great green beast.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A horse screamed as Saphira swept over the rows of tents to the clearing that was reserved for her. Eragon half stood in the saddle as Saphira flared her wings and slowed to a near standstill over the torn earth. The impact as she struck knocked Eragon forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Sorry</span>, she said. <span class="italic">I tried to land as softly as I could</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I know</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Even as he dismounted, Eragon saw Katrina hurrying toward him. Her long auburn hair swirled about her face as she walked across the <span>clearing</span>, and the press of the wind exposed the bulge of her growing belly through the layers of her dress.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What news?” she called, worry etched into every line of her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You heard about the werecats …?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“There’s no real news other than that. Roran’s fine; he said to give you his love.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her expression softened, but her worry did not entirely disappear. “He’s all right, then?” She motioned toward the ring she wore on the third finger of her left hand, one of the two rings Eragon had enchanted for her and Roran so they might know if one or the other was in danger. “I thought I felt something, about an hour ago, and I was afraid that …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shook his head. “Roran can tell you about it. He got a few nicks and bruises, but other than that, he’s fine. Scared me half to death, though.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina’s look of concern intensified. Then, with visible struggle, she smiled. “At least you’re safe. Both of you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They parted, and Eragon and Saphira made their way to one of the mess tents close to the Varden’s cookfires. There they gorged themselves on meat and mead while the wind howled around them and bursts of rain pummeled the sides of the flapping tent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Eragon bit into a slab of roast pork belly, Saphira said, <span class="italic">Is it good? Is it scrumptious</span>?</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mmm,” said Eragon, rivulets of juice running down his chin.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_21"></div></body>
