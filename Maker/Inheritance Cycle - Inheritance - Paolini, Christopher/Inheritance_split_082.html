<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">AS ERAGON MADE</span></span> his way down a flight of steps on his way toward the main entrance of the building, he happened upon the herbalist, Angela, sitting cross-legged in the dark alcove of a door. She was knitting what appeared to be a blue and white hat with strange runes along its lower part, the meaning of which was lost on him. Next to her lay Solembum, his head propped up in her lap and one of his heavy paws resting atop her right knee.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon stopped, surprised. He had not seen either of them since—it took him a moment to remember—since shortly after the battle in Urû’baen. Thereafter, they had seemed to disappear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Greetings,” said Angela without looking up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Greetings,” replied Eragon. “What are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Knitting a hat.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That I can see, but why here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Because I wanted to see you.” Her needles clacked with swift regularity, their motion as entrancing as the flames of a fire. “I heard tell that you, Saphira, the eggs, and the Eldunarí are leaving Alagaësia.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“As you predicted,” he retorted, frustrated that she had been able to discover what ought to have been the deepest secret. She could not have eavesdropped upon him and Nasuada—his wards would have prevented it—and so far as he knew, no one had told her or Solembum about the existence of the eggs or the Eldunarí.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well, yes, but I didn’t think to see you off.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How did you find out? From Arya?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Her? Ha! Hardly. No, I have my own ways of gathering information.” She paused in her knitting and looked up at him, her eyes <span>twinkling</span>. “Not that I’ll share them with you. I have to keep <span class="italic">some</span> secrets, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Humph.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Humph yourself. If you’re going to be that way, I’m not sure why I bothered coming.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m sorry. I’m just feeling a bit … uneasy.” After a moment, Eragon said, “Why did you want to see me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I <span class="italic">wanted</span> to say farewell and to wish you luck on your journey.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mmh. Try not to let yourself get too wrapped up in your head wherever you settle. Make sure you get out in the sun often enough.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I will. What of you and Solembum? Will you stay here for a while and watch over Elva? You mentioned you would.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The herbalist snorted in a very unladylike fashion. “Stay? How can I stay when Nasuada seems intent on spying on every magician in the land?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You heard about that as well?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She gave him a look. “I <span class="italic">disapprove</span>. I <span class="italic">disapprove</span> very much. I will not be treated like a child who has done something naughty. No, the time has come for Solembum and me to relocate to more friendly climes: the Beor Mountains, perhaps, or Du Weldenvarden.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon hesitated for a moment and then said, “Would you like to come with Saphira and me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Solembum opened one eye and studied him for a second before closing it again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That’s very kind of you,” said Angela, “but I think we will decline. At least, for the time being. Sitting around guarding the Eldunarí and training new Riders seems boring … although, raising a clutch of dragons is sure to prove exciting. But no; for the time being, Solembum and I will stay in Alagaësia. Besides, I want to keep an eye on Elva for the next few years, even if I can’t watch over her in person.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Haven’t you had your fill of interesting events?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Never. They’re the spice of life.” She held up her half-finished hat. “How do you like it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s nice. The blue is pretty. But what do the runes say?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Raxacori—Oh, never mind. It wouldn’t mean anything to you anyway. Safe travels to you and Saphira, Eragon. And remember to watch out for earwigs and wild hamsters. Ferocious things, wild hamsters.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He smiled despite himself. “Safe travels to you as well, and to you, Solembum.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The werecat’s eye opened again. <span class="italic">Safe travels, Kingkiller</span>.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Eragon left the building and picked his way through the city until he arrived at the house where Jeod and his wife, Helen, now lived. It was a stately hall, with high walls, a large garden, and bowing servants stationed within the entryway. Helen had done exceedingly well. By provisioning the Varden—and now Nasuada’s kingdom—with much-needed supplies, she had quickly built up a trading company larger than the one Jeod had once owned in Teirm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon found Jeod washing up in preparation for their evening meal. After refusing an offer to dine with them, Eragon spent a few minutes explaining to Jeod the same things he had explained to Nasuada. At first Jeod was surprised and somewhat upset, but in the end, he agreed that it was necessary for Eragon and Saphira to leave with the other dragons. As with Nasuada and the herbalist, Eragon also invited Jeod to accompany them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You tempt me sorely,” said Jeod. “But my place is here. I have my work, and for the first time in a long while, Helen is happy. Ilirea has become our home, and neither of us wants to pick up and move elsewhere.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded, understanding.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But you … you’re going to travel where few but the dragons or Riders have ever gone. Tell me, do you know what lies to the east? Is there another sea?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“If you travel far enough.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And before that?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon shrugged. “Empty land for the most part, or so the Eldunarí say, and I have no reason to think that’s changed in the past century.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Jeod moved closer to him and lowered his voice. “Since you are leaving … I will tell you this. Do you remember when I told you about the Arcaena, the order devoted to preserving knowledge throughout Alagaësia?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon nodded. “You said that Heslant the Monk belonged to them.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“As do I.” At Eragon’s look of surprise, Jeod made a sheepish gesture and ran his hand through his hair. “I joined them long ago, when I was young and looking for a cause to serve. I’ve provided them with information and manuscripts throughout the years, and they’ve helped me in return. Anyway, I thought you should know. Brom was the only other person I’ve told.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not even Helen?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not even her. … Anyway, when I finish writing my account of you and Saphira and the rise of the Varden, I’ll send it to our monastery in the Spine, and it will be included as a number of new chapters in <span class="italic">Domia abr Wyrda</span>. Your story will not be forgotten, Eragon; that much, at least, I can promise you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon found the knowledge strangely affecting. “Thank you,” he said, and grasped Jeod by the forearm.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And you, Eragon Shadeslayer.”</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Afterward, Eragon made his way back to the hall, where he and Saphira had been living along with Roran and Katrina, who were waiting to eat with him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">All through supper, the talk was of Arya and Fírnen. Eragon held his tongue about his plans for departure until after the food was gone and the three of them—and the baby—had retired to a room <span>overlooking</span> the courtyard, where Saphira lay napping with Fírnen. There they sat drinking wine and tea and watching as the sun descended toward the distant horizon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When an appropriate amount of time had passed, Eragon broached the subject. As he expected, Katrina and Roran reacted with dismay and tried to convince him to change his mind. It took Eragon nearly an hour to lay out his reasons to them, for they argued every point and refused to concede until he answered their objections in exacting detail.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Finally, Roran said, “Blast it, you’re family! You can’t leave!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I have to. You know it as well as I do; you just don’t want to admit it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran struck his fist against the table between them and then strode over to the open window, the muscles in his jaw clenching.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The baby squalled, and Katrina said, “Shh, now,” and patted her on the back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon joined Roran. “I know it isn’t what you want. I don’t want it either, but I have no choice.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Of course you have a choice. You of all people have a choice.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye, and this is the right thing to do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran grunted and crossed his arms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Behind them, Katrina said, “If you leave, you won’t be able to be an uncle to Ismira. Is she supposed to grow up without ever knowing you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Eragon, going back to her. “I’ll still be able to talk with her, and I’ll see to it that she’s well protected; I may even be able to send her presents from time to time.” He knelt and held out a finger, and the girl wrapped a hand around it and tugged with precocious strength.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But you won’t be here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No … I won’t be here.” Eragon gently extricated his finger from Ismira’s grip and returned to stand by Roran. “As I said, you could join me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The muscles in Roran’s jaw shifted. “And give up Palancar <span>Valley</span>?” He shook his head. “Horst and the others are already preparing to return. We’ll rebuild Carvahall as the finest town in the whole Spine. You could help; it would be like before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I wish I could.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Below, Saphira uttered a throaty gurgle and nuzzled the side of Fírnen’s neck. The green dragon snuggled closer to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">In a low voice, Roran said, “Is there no other way, Eragon?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not that Saphira or I can think of.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Blast it—it’s not right. You shouldn’t have to go live by yourself in the wilderness.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I won’t be entirely alone. Blödhgarm and a few other elves will be going with us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran made an impatient gesture. “You know what I mean.” He gnawed on the corner of his mustache and leaned on his hands against the stone lip underneath the window. Eragon could see the sinews in his thick forearms knotting and flexing. Then Roran looked at him and said, “What will you do once you get to wherever you’re going?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Find a hill or a cliff and build a hall atop it: a hall large enough to house all the dragons and keep them safe. And you? Once you rebuild the village, what then?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A faint smile appeared on Roran’s face. “Something similar. With the tribute from the valley, I plan to build a castle atop that hill we always talked about. Not a big castle, mind you; just a bit of stonework with a wall, enough to hold off any Urgals who might decide to attack. It’ll probably take a few years, but then we’ll have a proper way to defend ourselves, unlike when the Ra’zac came with the soldiers.” He cast a sideways glance at Eragon. “We’d have room for a dragon as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Would you have room for <span class="italic">two</span> dragons?” Eragon gestured toward Saphira and Fírnen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Maybe not. … How does Saphira feel about having to leave him?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“She doesn’t like it, but she knows it’s necessary.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mmh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The amber light from the dying sun accentuated the planes of Roran’s face; somewhat to Eragon’s surprise, he saw the beginnings of lines and wrinkles on his cousin’s brow and around his eyes. He found the signs of encroaching age sobering. <span class="italic">How quickly life passes</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina laid Ismira in a cradle. Then she joined them at the window and placed a hand on Eragon’s shoulder. “We’ll miss you, Eragon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And I you,” he said, and touched her hand. “We don’t have to say goodbye quite yet, though. I’d like the three of you to come with us to Ellesméra. You would enjoy seeing it, I think, and that way we could spend another few days together.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran swiveled his head toward Eragon. “We can’t travel all the way to Du Weldenvarden with Ismira. She’s too young. Returning to Palancar Valley is going to be difficult enough; a side trip to Ellesméra is out of the question.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not even if it was on dragonback?” Eragon laughed at their surprised expressions. “Arya and Fírnen have agreed to carry you to Ellesméra while Saphira and I fetch the dragon eggs from where they’re hidden.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How long would the flight to Ellesméra take?” asked Roran, frowning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“A week or so. Arya intends to visit King Orik in Tronjheim on the way. You would be warm and safe the whole while. Ismira wouldn’t be in any danger.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina looked at Roran, and he at her, and she said, “It would be nice to see Eragon off, and I’ve always heard tell of how beautiful the elves’ cities are. …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Are you sure you would be up to it?” asked Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded. “As long as you’re there with us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran was silent for a moment; then he said, “Well, I suppose Horst and the others can go on ahead without us.” A smile appeared under his beard, and he chuckled. “I never thought to see the Beor <span>Mountains</span> or to stand in one of the elves’ cities, but why not, eh? We might as well while we have the chance.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Good, that’s settled, then,” said Katrina, beaming. “We’re going to Du Weldenvarden.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“How will we get back?” asked Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“On Fírnen,” said Eragon. “Or I’m sure Arya would give you guards to escort you to Palancar Valley, if you would prefer to travel by horse.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran grimaced. “No, not by horse. If I never have to ride another horse in my life, it would be too soon by half.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Oh? Then I take it you don’t want Snowfire anymore?” said Eragon, raising an eyebrow as he named the stallion he had given Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You know what I mean. I’m glad to have Snowfire, even if I haven’t had need of him for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mm-hmm.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">They stood by the window for another hour or so—as the sun set and the sky turned purple and then black and the stars came out—planning their upcoming trip and discussing the things Eragon and Saphira would need to take with them when they left Du Weldenvarden for the lands beyond. Behind them, Ismira slept peacefully in her cradle, her hands balled up in tiny fists beneath her chin.</span></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">Early the next morning, Eragon used the polished silver mirror in his room to contact Orik in Tronjheim. He had to wait for a few minutes, but eventually Orik’s face appeared before him, the dwarf running an ivory comb through his unbraided beard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eragon!” Orik exclaimed with obvious delight. “How are you? It’s been too long since last we spoke.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Feeling a bit guilty, Eragon agreed. Then he told Orik of his decision to leave and the reasons why. Orik stopped combing and listened without interrupting, his expression serious throughout. <span>When</span> Eragon finished, Orik said, “I will be sad to see you go, but I agree, this is what you must do. I have thought about this myself—worried about where the dragons might live—but I kept my concerns to myself, for the dragons have as much right to share the land as we do, even if we do not like it when they eat our Feldûnost and burn our villages. However, raising them elsewhere will be for the best.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I am glad you approve,” said Eragon. He talked to Orik about his idea for the Urgals, then, which involved the dwarves as well. This time Orik asked many questions, and Eragon could see that he was doubtful about the proposal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a long silence wherein Orik stared down into his beard, the dwarf said, “If you had asked this of any of the grimstnzborithn before me, they would have said no. Had you asked me at any time before we invaded the Empire, I would also have said no. But now, after having fought alongside the Urgals, and after having seen in person how helpless we were before Murtagh and Thorn and Galbatorix and that monster Shruikan … now I no longer feel the same.” He gazed up through his bushy eyebrows at Eragon. “It may cost me mine crown, but on behalf of knurlan everywhere I will accept—for their own good, whether or not they realize it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Again Eragon felt proud to have Orik as his foster brother. “Thank you,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Orik grunted. “My people never desired this, but I am grateful for it. When will we know?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Within a few days. A week at most.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Will we feel anything?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Maybe. I’ll ask Arya. Either way, I’ll contact you again once it’s done.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Good. Then we will speak later. Safe travels and sound stone, Eragon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“May Helzvog watch over you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre16"><img alt="figure" src="images/00005.jpg" class="calibre29"/></p><div class="calibre15"> </div>
<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5">The following day, they departed Ilirea.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It was a private event, devoid of fanfare, for which Eragon was grateful. Nasuada, Jörmundur, Jeod, and Elva met them outside the city’s southern gate, where Saphira and Fírnen sat side by side, pushing their heads against one another while Eragon and Arya inspected their saddles. Roran and Katrina arrived a few minutes later: Katrina carrying Ismira swaddled in a blanket, and Roran carrying two packs full of blankets, food, and other supplies, one slung over each shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran gave his packs to Arya, and she tied them atop Fírnen’s saddlebags.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon and Saphira said their last farewells, which was harder for Eragon than for Saphira. His were not the only eyes with tears, however; both Nasuada and Jeod wept as they embraced him and offered him and Saphira their good wishes. Nasuada also said farewell to Roran, and she again thanked him for his help against the Empire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last, as Eragon, Arya, Roran, and Katrina were about to climb onto the dragons, a woman called out, “Hold there!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon paused with his foot atop Saphira’s right foreleg and looked to see Birgit striding toward them from the city gates, gray skirts billowing, and her young son, Nolfavrell, trailing after her with a helpless expression on his face. In one hand, Birgit carried a drawn sword. In the other, a round wooden shield.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon’s stomach sank.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada’s guards moved to intercept the two of them, but Roran shouted, “Let them pass!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada signaled to the guards and they stepped aside.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Without slowing, Birgit walked over to Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Birgit, please don’t,” said Katrina in a low voice, but the other woman ignored her. Arya watched them unblinkingly, her hand on her sword.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Stronghammer. I always said that I would have my compensation from you for my husband’s death, and now I have come to <span>claim</span> it, as is my right. Will you fight me, or will you pay the debt that is yours?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon went to stand by Roran. “Birgit, why are you doing this? Why now? Can’t you forgive him and let old sorrows rest?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Do you want me to eat her</span>? asked Saphira.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Not yet</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Birgit ignored him and kept her gaze fixed on Roran.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Mother,” said Nolfavrell, tugging on her skirts, but she showed no reaction to his plea.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada joined them. “I know you,” she said to Birgit. “You fought with the men during the war.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes, Your Majesty.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What quarrel have you with Roran? He has proved himself a fine and valuable warrior on more than one occasion, and I would be most displeased to lose him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He and his family were responsible for the soldiers killing my husband.” She looked at Nasuada for a moment. “The Ra’zac <span class="italic">ate</span> him, Your Majesty. They ate him and they sucked the marrow from his bones. I cannot forgive that, and I <span class="italic">will</span> have my compensation for it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It was not Roran’s fault,” said Nasuada. “This is unreasonable, and I forbid it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No, it’s not,” said Eragon, though he hated to. “By our custom, she has the right to demand a blood price from everyone who was responsible for Quimby’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But it wasn’t Roran’s fault!” exclaimed Katrina.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But it was,” said Roran in a low voice. “I could have turned myself over to the soldiers. I could have led them away. Or I could have attacked. But I didn’t. I chose to hide, and Quimby died as a result.” He glanced at Nasuada. “This is a matter we must settle among ourselves, Your Majesty. It is a matter of honor, even as the Trial of the Long Knives was for you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nasuada frowned and looked to Eragon. He nodded, so with reluctance, she stepped back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What will it be, Stronghammer?” asked Birgit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eragon and I killed the Ra’zac in Helgrind,” said Roran. “Is that not enough?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Birgit shook her head, her determination never wavering. “No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran paused then, the muscles in his neck rigid. “Is this what you really want, Birgit?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It is.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then I will pay my debt.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Roran spoke, Katrina uttered a wail and thrust herself between him and Birgit, still holding their daughter in her arms. “I won’t let you! You can’t have him! Not now! Not after everything we’ve gone through!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Birgit’s face remained as stone, and she made no move to retreat. Likewise, Roran showed no emotion as he grasped Katrina by the waist and, without apparent effort, lifted her off to the side. “Hold her, would you?” he said to Eragon in a cold voice.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Roran …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His cousin gave him a flat stare, then turned back to Birgit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon grabbed hold of Katrina’s shoulders to keep her from flinging herself after Roran, and he exchanged a helpless look with Arya. She glanced toward her sword, and he shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Let go of me! Let go!” shouted Katrina. In her arms, the baby began to scream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Never taking his eyes off the woman before him, Roran undid his belt and dropped it to the ground, along with his dagger and his hammer, which one of the Varden had found in the streets of Ilirea soon after Galbatorix’s death. Then Roran pulled open the front of his tunic and bared his hair-covered chest.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eragon, remove my wards,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Remove them!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Roran, no!” shouted Katrina. “Defend yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">He’s mad</span>, thought Eragon, but he dared not interfere. If he <span>stopped</span> Birgit, he would shame Roran, and the people of Palancar Valley would lose all respect for his cousin. And Roran, Eragon knew, would rather die than allow that to happen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Nevertheless, Eragon had no intention of letting Birgit kill Roran. He would let her have her price, but no more. Speaking softly in the ancient language—so that none might hear the words he used—he did as Roran had asked, but he also placed three new wards upon his cousin: one to protect the spine within his neck from being severed; one to keep his skull from being broken; and one to safeguard his organs. All else Eragon felt confident he could heal if necessary, as long as Birgit did not start cutting off limbs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It is done,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran nodded and to Birgit said, “Take your price of me, then, and let this be an end to the quarrel between us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You will not fight me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Birgit eyed him for a moment; then she threw her shield onto the ground, crossed the few remaining feet that separated her from Roran, and placed the edge of her sword against Roran’s breast. In a voice loud enough for only Roran to hear—though Eragon and Arya did as well with their catlike acuity—she said, “I loved Quimby. He was my life, and he died because of you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m sorry,” Roran whispered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Birgit,” pleaded Katrina. “Please …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">No one moved, not even the dragons. Eragon found himself holding his breath. The hiccupping crying of the baby was the loudest sound.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Birgit lifted the sword from Roran’s breast. She reached down to take his right hand and drew the edge of the sword across his palm. Roran winced as the blade cut into his hand, but he did not pull away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A crimson line appeared upon his skin. Blood filled his palm and spilled dripping to the ground, where it soaked into the trampled earth, leaving a dark blotch upon the dirt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Birgit ceased pulling on the sword and held it motionless against Roran’s palm for a moment more. Then she stepped back and lowered the scarlet-edged sword to her side. Roran closed his fingers around his palm, blood flowing between them, and pressed his hand against his hip.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I have had my price,” said Birgit. “Our quarrel is at an end.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then she turned, picked up her shield, and strode back to the city, with Nolfavrell dogging her heels.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon released Katrina, and she rushed to Roran’s side. “You fool,” she said, a bitter note in her voice. “You stubborn, pigheaded fool. Here, let me see.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It was the only way,” said Roran, as if from far away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina frowned, her face hard and strained as she examined the cut on his hand. “Eragon, you should heal this.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No,” said Roran with sudden sharpness. He closed his hand again. “No, this is one scar I’ll keep.” He looked around. “Is there a strip of fabric I can use as a bandage?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After a moment of confusion, Nasuada pointed to one of her guards and said, “Cut off the bottom part of your tunic and give it to him.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Wait,” said Eragon as Roran started to wrap the strip around his hand. “I won’t heal it, but at least let me cast a spell to keep the cut from getting infected, all right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran hesitated. Then he nodded and held out his hand toward Eragon.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">It took Eragon only a few seconds to mouth the spell. “There,” he said. “Now it won’t turn green and purple and swell up as large as a pig’s bladder.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran grunted, and Katrina said, “Thank you, Eragon.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Now, shall we leave?” asked Arya.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The five of them climbed onto the dragons, Arya helping Roran and Katrina safely into the saddle on Fírnen’s back, which had been modified with loops and straps to hold additional passengers. Once they were properly seated atop the green dragon, Arya raised <span>a</span> hand. “Farewell, Nasuada! Farewell, Eragon and Saphira! We will expect you in Ellesméra!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Farewell!</span> said Fírnen in his deep voice. He spread his wings and jumped skyward, flapping quickly to lift the weight of the four people on his back, helped by the strength of the two Eldunarí Arya was taking with her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira roared after him, and Fírnen replied with a trumpeted bugle before arrowing his way toward the southeast and the distant Beor Mountains.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon twisted around in his saddle and waved to Nasuada, Elva, Jörmundur, and Jeod. They waved in return, and Jörmundur shouted, “Best of luck to the both of you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Goodbye,” cried Elva.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Goodbye!” shouted Nasuada. “Be safe!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon replied in kind, and then he turned his back to them, unable to bear the sight any longer. Saphira crouched underneath him and sprang into the air as they began the first leg of their long, long journey.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Saphira circled as she gained altitude. Below, Eragon saw Nasuada and the others standing in a clump by the city walls, Elva holding up a small white kerchief, which fluttered in the gusts of wind from Saphira’s passage.</span></p>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_166"></div></body>
