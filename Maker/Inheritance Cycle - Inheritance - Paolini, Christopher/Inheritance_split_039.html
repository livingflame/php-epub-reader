<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27"><span class="italic">AT LAST!</span> THOUGHT</span></span> Roran as the Varden’s horns sounded the advance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He glanced at Dras-Leona and caught a glimpse of Saphira diving toward the dark mass of buildings, her scales blazing in the light of the rising sun. Below, Thorn stirred, like some great cat that had been sunning itself on a fence, and took off in pursuit.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A surge of energy coursed through Roran. The time for battle had finally arrived, and he was eager to be done with it. He spared a quick thought of concern for Eragon, then pushed himself off the log where he was sitting and trotted over to join the rest of the men as they gathered in a wide rectangular formation.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran glanced up and down the ranks, checking that the troops were ready. They had been waiting for most of the night, and the men were tired, but he knew that fear and excitement would soon clear their minds. Roran was tired as well, but he paid it no mind; he could sleep when the battle was over. Until then, his main concern was keeping his men and himself alive.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He did wish he had time for a cup of hot tea, though, to help settle his stomach. He had eaten something bad for dinner and had been racked with cramps and nausea ever since. Still, the discomfort was not enough to prevent him from fighting. Or so he hoped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Satisfied with the state of his men, Roran pulled on his helm, pushing it down over his quilted arming cap. Then he drew his hammer and slipped his left arm through the straps on his shield.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“At your command,” said Horst, walking up to him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran nodded. He had chosen the smith as his second in command, a decision that Nasuada had accepted without dissent. Other <span>than</span> Eragon, there was no one Roran would rather have by his side. It was selfish of him, he knew—Horst had a newborn child, and the Varden needed his metalworking skills—but Roran could not think of anyone else as well suited for the job. Horst had not seemed especially pleased by the promotion, but neither had he seemed upset. Instead, he had gone about organizing Roran’s battalion with the calm assurance and competency that Roran knew he possessed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The horns sounded again, and Roran lifted his hammer over his head. “Forward!” he shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He took the lead as the many hundreds of men started off, accompanied on either side by the Varden’s four other battalions.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As the warriors trotted across the open fields that separated them from Dras-Leona, cries of alarm rang out in the city. Bells and horns sounded a moment later, and soon the whole city was filled with an angry clamor as the defenders roused themselves. Adding to the commotion were the most terrible roars and crashes from the center of the city, where the two dragons were fighting. Occasionally, Roran saw one or another of them appear above the tops of the buildings, the dragon’s hide bright and sparkling, but for the most part, the two giants remained hidden from sight.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The maze of ramshackle buildings that surrounded the city walls quickly drew near. The narrow, gloomy streets looked ominous and foreboding to Roran. It would be easy for the Empire’s soldiers—or even the citizens of Dras-Leona—to ambush them within the twisting passageways. Fighting in such close quarters would be even more brutal, confusing, and messy than normal. If it came to that, Roran knew that few of his men would escape unscathed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he moved into the shadows beneath the eaves of the first line of hovels, a hard knot of unease settled in Roran’s gut, exacerbating his queasiness. He licked his lips, feeling sick.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Eragon had better open that gate</span>, he thought. <span class="italic">If not … we’ll be stuck out here like so many lambs penned up for slaughter</span>.</span></p>
