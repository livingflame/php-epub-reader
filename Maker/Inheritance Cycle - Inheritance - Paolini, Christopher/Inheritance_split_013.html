<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27">THE MUD CLUNG</span></span> to Roran’s boots each time he lifted his feet, slowing his progress and making his already-tired legs burn from the effort. It felt as if the very ground were trying to pull off his shoes. Thick as it was, the mud was also slippery. It gave way under his heels at the worst moments, just when his position was the most precarious. And it was deep, too. The constant passage of men, animals, and wagons had turned the top six inches of earth into a nigh on impassable morass. A few patches of crushed grass remained along the edges of the track—which ran straight through the Varden’s camp—but Roran suspected they would soon vanish as men sought to avoid the center of the lane.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran made no attempt to evade the muck; he no longer cared if his clothes stayed clean. Besides, he was so exhausted, it was easier to keep plodding in the same direction than to worry about picking a path from one island of grass to the next.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he stumbled forward, Roran thought of Belatona. Since Nasuada’s audience with the werecats, he had been setting up a command post in the northwest quarter of the city and doing his best to establish control over the quadrant by assigning men to put out fires, build barricades in the streets, search houses for soldiers, and confiscate weapons. It was an immense task, and he despaired of accomplishing what was needed, fearing that the city might erupt into open battle again. <span class="italic">I hope those idiots can make it through the night without getting killed</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">His left side throbbed, causing him to bare his teeth and suck in his breath.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">Blasted coward</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Someone had shot at him with a crossbow from the roof of a building. Only the sheerest of luck had saved him; one of his men, Mortenson, had stepped in front of him at the exact moment the attacker had fired. The bolt had punched through Mortenson from back to belly and had still retained enough force to give Roran a nasty bruise. Mortenson had died on the spot, and whoever had shot the crossbow had escaped.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Five minutes later, an explosion of some sort, possibly magical, had killed two more of his men when they entered a stable to investigate a noise.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">From what Roran understood, such attacks were common throughout the city. No doubt, Galbatorix’s agents were behind many of them, but the inhabitants of Belatona were also responsible—men and women who could not bear to stand by idly while an invading army seized control of their home, no matter how honorable the Varden’s intentions might be. Roran could sympathize with the people who felt they had to defend their families, but at the same time, he cursed them for being so thick-skulled that they could not recognize the Varden were trying to help them, not hurt them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He scratched at his beard while he waited for a dwarf to pull a heavily laden pony out of his way, then continued slogging forward.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As he drew near their tent, he saw Katrina standing over a tub of hot, soapy water, scrubbing a bloodstained bandage against a washboard. Her sleeves were rolled up past her elbows, her hair tied in a messy bun, and her cheeks flushed from her work, but she had never looked so beautiful to him. She was his comfort—his comfort and his refuge—and just seeing her helped ease the sense of numb dislocation that gripped him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She noticed him and immediately abandoned her washing and ran toward him, drying her pink hands on the front of her dress. Roran braced himself as she threw herself at him, wrapping her <span>arms</span> around his chest. His side flared with pain, and he uttered a short grunt.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina loosened her hold and leaned away, frowning. “Oh! Did I hurt you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No … no. I’m just sore.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She did not question him but hugged him again, more gently, and looked up at him, her eyes glistening with tears. Holding her by the waist, he bent and kissed her, inexpressibly grateful for her presence.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina slipped his left arm over her shoulders, and he allowed her to support part of his weight as they returned to their tent. With a sigh, Roran sat on the stump they used for a chair, which Katrina had placed next to the small fire she had built to heat the tub of water and over which a pot of stew was now simmering.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina filled a bowl with stew and handed it to him. Then, from within the tent, she brought him a mug of ale and a plate with a half loaf of bread and a wedge of cheese. “Is there anything else you need?” she asked, her voice unusually hoarse.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran did not answer, but cupped her cheek and stroked it twice with his thumb. She smiled tremulously and laid a hand over his, then returned to washing and began to scrub with renewed vigor.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran stared at the food for a long time before he took a bite; he was still so tense, he doubted he could stomach it. After a few mouthfuls of bread, however, his appetite returned, and he began to consume the stew with eagerness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When he was done, he placed the dishes on the ground and then sat warming his hands over the fire while he nursed the last few sips of beer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We heard the crash when the gates fell,” said Katrina, wringing a bandage dry. “They didn’t hold for very long.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No. … It helps to have a dragon on your side.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran gazed at her belly as she draped the bandage over the makeshift clothesline that ran from the peak of their tent across to a <span>neighboring</span> one. Whenever he thought of the child she was carrying, the child that the two of them had created, he felt an enormous sense of pride, but it was tinged with anxiety, for he did not know how he could hope to provide a safe home for their baby. Also, if the war was not over by the time Katrina gave birth, she intended to leave him and go to Surda, where she might raise their child in relative safety.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5"><span class="italic">I can’t lose her, not again</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina immersed another bandage in the tub. “And the battle in the city?” she asked, churning the water. “How went it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“We had to fight for every foot. Even Eragon had a hard time of it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“The wounded spoke of ballistae mounted on wheels.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye.” Roran wet his tongue with ale, then quickly described how the Varden had moved through Belatona and the setbacks they had encountered along the way. “We lost too many men today, but it could have been worse. Much worse. Jörmundur and Captain Martland planned the attack well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Their plan wouldn’t have worked, though, if not for you and Eragon. You acquitted yourself most bravely.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran loosed a single bark of laughter: “Ha! And do you know why that is? I’ll tell you. Not one man in ten is actually willing to attack the enemy. Eragon doesn’t see it; he’s always at the forefront of the battle, driving the soldiers before him, but I see it. Most of the men hang back and don’t fight unless they are cornered. Or they wave their arms about and make a lot of noise but don’t actually do anything.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina looked appalled. “How can that be? Are they cowards?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t know. I think … I think that, perhaps, they just can’t bring themselves to look a man in the face and kill him, although it seems easy enough for them to cut down soldiers whose backs are turned. So they wait for others to do what they cannot. They wait for people like me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you think Galbatorix’s men are equally reluctant?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran shrugged. “They might be. But then, they have no choice but to obey Galbatorix. If he orders them to fight, they fight.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Nasuada could do the same. She could have her magicians cast spells to ensure that no one shirks their duty.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What difference would there be between her and Galbatorix, then? In any case, the Varden wouldn’t stand for it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Katrina left her washing to come and kiss him on the forehead. “I’m glad you can do what you do,” she whispered. She returned to the tub and began scrubbing another strip of soiled linen over the washboard. “I felt something earlier, from my ring. … I thought maybe something had happened to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I was in the middle of a battle. It wouldn’t be surprising if you had felt a twinge every few minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She paused with her arms in the water. “I never have before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He drained the mug of ale, seeking to delay the inevitable. He had hoped to spare her the details of his misadventure in the castle, but it was plain that she would not rest until she knew the truth. Attempting to convince her otherwise would only lead her to imagine calamities far worse than what had actually occurred. Besides, it would be pointless for him to hold back when news of the event would soon be common throughout the Varden.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">So he told her. He gave her a brief account and tried to make the collapse of the wall seem more like a minor inconvenience rather than something that had almost killed him. Still, he found it difficult to describe the experience, and he spoke haltingly, searching for the right words. When he finished, he fell silent, troubled by the remembrance.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“At least you weren’t hurt,” said Katrina.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He picked at a crack in the lip of the mug. “No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The sound of sloshing water ceased, and he could feel her eyes heavy upon him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You’ve faced far greater danger before.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes … I suppose.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her voice softened. “What’s wrong, then?” When he did not <span>answer</span>, she said, “There’s nothing so terrible you can’t tell me, Roran. You know that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The edge of his right thumbnail tore as he picked at the mug again. He rubbed the sharp flap against his forefinger several times. “I thought I was going to die when the wall fell.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Anyone might have.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes, but the thing is, I didn’t <span class="italic">mind</span>.” Anguished, he looked at her. “Don’t you understand? <span class="italic">I gave up</span>. When I realized I couldn’t escape, I accepted it as meekly as a lamb led to slaughter, and I—” Unable to continue, he dropped the mug and hid his face in his hands. The swelling in his throat made it hard to breathe. Then he felt Katrina’s fingers light upon his shoulders. “I gave up,” he growled, furious and disgusted with himself. “I just stopped fighting. … For you … For our child.” He choked on the words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Shh, shh,” she murmured.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’ve never given up before. Not once. … Not even when the Ra’zac took you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I know you haven’t.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“This fighting has to end. It can’t go on like this. … I can’t … I—” He raised his head and was horrified to see that she too was on the verge of tears. Standing, he wrapped his arms around her and held her close. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. … It won’t happen again. Never again. I promise.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t care about <span class="italic">that</span>,” she said, her voice muffled against his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Her reply stung him. “I know I was weak, but my word still ought to be worth something to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That’s not what I meant!” she exclaimed, and drew back to look at him accusingly. “You’re a fool sometimes, Roran.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He smiled slightly. “I know.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She clasped her hands behind his neck. “I wouldn’t think any less of you, regardless of what you felt when the wall came down. All that matters is that you’re still alive. … There wasn’t anything you could do when the wall fell, was there?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He shook his head.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Then you have nothing to be ashamed of. If you could have stopped it, or if you could have escaped but you didn’t, then you would have lost my respect. But you did everything you could, and when you could do no more, you made peace with your fate, and you didn’t rail needlessly against it. That is wisdom, not weakness.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He bowed and kissed her on the brow. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“And as far as I am concerned, you are the bravest, strongest, kindest man in all of Alagaësia.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">This time he kissed her on the mouth. Afterward, she laughed, a short, quick release of pent-up tension, and they stood swaying together, as if dancing to a melody only they could hear.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Katrina gave him a playful push and went to finish the washing, and he settled back on the stump, content for the first time since the battle, despite his numerous aches and pains.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran watched the men, horses, and the occasional dwarf or Urgal slog past their tent, noting their wounds and the condition of their weapons and armor. He tried to gauge the general mood of the Varden; the only conclusion he reached was that everyone but the Urgals needed a good sleep and a decent meal, and that everyone, including the Urgals—especially the Urgals—needed to be scoured from head to foot with a hog’s-hair brush and buckets of soapy water.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He also watched Katrina, and he saw how, as she worked, her initial good cheer gradually faded and she became ever more irritable. She kept scrubbing and scrubbing at several stains, but with little success. A scowl darkened her face, and she began to make small noises of frustration.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">At last, when she had slapped the wad of fabric against the washboard, splashing foamy water several feet into the air, and leaned on the tub, her lips pressed tightly together, Roran pushed himself off the stump and made his way to her side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Here, let me,” he said.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It wouldn’t be fitting,” she muttered.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Nonsense. Go sit down, and I’ll finish. … Go on.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She shook her head. “No. You should be the one resting, not me. Besides, this isn’t man’s work.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He snorted with derision. “By whose decree? A man’s work, or a woman’s, is whatever needs to be done. Now go sit down; you’ll feel better once you’re off your feet.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Roran, I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Don’t be silly.” He gently tried to push her away from the tub, but she refused to budge.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s not right,” she protested. “What would people think?” She gestured at the men hurrying along the muddy lane next to their tent.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“They can think whatever they want. I married you, not them. If they believe I’m any less of a man for helping you, then they’re fools.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But nothing. Move. Shoo. Get out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“But—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’m not going to argue. If you don’t go sit, I’m going to carry you over there and tie you to that stump.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A bemused expression replaced her scowl. “Is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Yes. Now go!” As she reluctantly ceded her position at the tub, he made a noise of exasperation. “Stubborn, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Speak for yourself. You could teach a mule a thing or two.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Not me. I’m not stubborn.” Undoing his belt, he removed his mail shirt and hung it on the front pole of the tent, then peeled off his gloves and rolled up the sleeves of his tunic. The air was cool against his skin, and the bandages were colder still—they had grown chill while lying exposed on the washboard—but he did not mind, for the water was warm, and soon the cloth was as well. Frothy mounds of iridescent bubbles built up around his wrists as he pushed and pulled the material across the full length of the knobby board.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He glanced over and was pleased to see that Katrina was relaxing <span>on</span> the stump, at least as much as anyone could relax on such a rough seat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Do you want some chamomile tea?” she asked. “Gertrude gave me a handful of fresh sprigs this morning. I can make a pot for both of us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I’d like that.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A companionable silence developed between them as Roran proceeded to wash the rest of the laundry. The task lulled him into a pleasant mood; he enjoyed doing something with his hands other than swinging his hammer, and being close to Katrina gave him a deep sense of satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He was in the middle of wringing out the last item, and his freshly poured tea was waiting for him next to Katrina, when someone shouted their names from across the busy way. It took Roran a moment to realize it was Baldor running toward them through the mud, weaving between men and horses. He wore a pitted leather apron and heavy, elbow-length gloves that were smeared with soot and were so worn that the fingers were as hard, smooth, and shiny as polished tortoise shells. A scrap of torn leather held back his dark, shaggy hair, and a frown creased his forehead. Baldor was smaller than his father, Horst, and his older brother, Albriech, but by any other comparison, he was large and well muscled, the result of having spent his childhood helping Horst in his forge. None of the three had fought that day—skilled smiths were normally too valuable to risk in battle—although Roran wished Nasuada had let them, for they were able warriors and Roran knew he could count on them even in the most dire circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Roran put down the washing and dried his hands, wondering what could be amiss. Rising from the stump, Katrina joined him by the tub.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">When Baldor reached them, they had to wait several seconds for him to regain his breath. Then, in a rush, he said, “Come quickly. Mother just went into labor, and—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Where is she?” asked Katrina in a sharp tone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“At our tent.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She nodded. “We’ll be there as fast as we can.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">With a grateful expression, Baldor turned and sprinted away.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">As Katrina ducked inside their tent, Roran poured the contents of the tub over the fire, extinguishing it. The burning wood hissed and cracked under the deluge, and a cloud of steam jetted upward in place of smoke, filling the air with an unpleasant smell.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Dread and excitement quickened Roran’s movements. <span class="italic">I hope she doesn’t die</span>, he thought, remembering the talk he had heard among the women concerning her age and overlong pregnancy. Elain had always been kind to him and to Eragon, and he was fond of her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Are you ready?” asked Katrina as she emerged from the tent, knotting a blue scarf around her head and neck.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He grabbed his belt and hammer from where they hung. “Ready. Let’s go.”</span></p>
