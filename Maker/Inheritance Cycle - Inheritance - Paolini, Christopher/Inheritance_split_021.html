<p class="calibre14"><span class="calibre5"><span><span class="calibre27"><span class="italic">IT’S LATE</span>, SAID</span></span> Saphira as Eragon sauntered toward his tent, beside which she lay coiled, sparkling like a mound of azure coals in the dim light of the torches. She regarded him with a single, heavy-lidded eye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He crouched by her head and pressed his brow against hers for several moments, hugging her spiky jaw. <span class="italic">So it is</span>, he said at last. <span class="italic">And you need your rest after flying into the wind all day. Sleep, and I’ll see you in the morning</span>.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">She blinked once in acknowledgment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Inside his tent, Eragon lit a single candle for comfort. Then he pulled off his boots and sat on his cot with his legs folded under him. He slowed his breathing and allowed his mind to open and expand outward to touch all of the living things around him, from the worms and the insects in the ground to Saphira and the warriors of the Varden, and even the few remaining plants nearby, the energy from which was pale and hard to see compared with the burning brilliance of even the smallest animal.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">For a long while, he sat there, empty of thoughts, aware of a thousand sensations, the sharp and the subtle, concentrating on nothing but the steady inflow and outflow of air in his lungs.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Off in the distance, he heard men talking as they stood around a watchfire. The night air carried their voices farther than they intended, far enough that his keen ears were able to make out their words. He could sense their minds as well, and he could have read their thoughts had he wanted, but instead he chose to respect their innermost privacy and merely listen.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A deep-voiced fellow was saying, “—and the way they stare down their noses at you, as if you’re the lowest of the low. Half the time they won’t even talk to you when you ask them a friendly question. They just turn their shoulder and walk away.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye,” said another man. “And their women—as beautiful as statues and about half as inviting.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That’s because you’re a right ugly bastard, Svern, that’s why.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“It’s not my fault my father had a habit of seducing milkmaids wherever he went. Besides, you’re hardly one to point fingers; you could give children nightmares with that face of yours.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The deep-voiced warrior grunted; then someone coughed and spat, and Eragon heard the sizzle of moisture evaporating as it struck a piece of burning wood.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A third speaker entered the conversation: “I don’t like the elves any more than you do, but we need them to win this war.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What if they turn on us afterward, though?” asked the deep-voiced man.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Hear, hear,” added Svern. “Look what happened at Ceunon and Gil’ead. All his men, all his power, and Galbatorix still couldn’t stop them from swarming over the walls.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Maybe he wasn’t trying,” suggested the third speaker.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">A long pause followed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then the deep-voiced man said, “Now, there’s a singularly unpleasant thought. … Still, whether he was or wasn’t, I don’t see how we could hold off the elves if they decided to reclaim their old territories. They’re faster and stronger than we are, and unlike us, there’s not one of them who can’t use magic.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Ah, but we have Eragon,” Svern countered. “He could drive them back to their forest all by himself, if he wanted to.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Him? Bah! He looks more like an elf than he does his own flesh and blood. I wouldn’t count on his loyalty any more than the Urgals’.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The third man spoke up again: “Have you noticed, he’s always freshly shaven, no matter how early in the morning we break camp?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“He must use magic for a razor.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Goes against the natural order of things, it does. That and all the other spells being tossed around nowadays. Makes you want to hide in a cave somewhere and let the magicians kill each other off without any interference from us.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“I don’t seem to recall you complaining when the healers used a spell instead of a pair of tongs to remove that arrow from your shoulder.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Maybe, but the arrow never would have ended up in my shoulder if it weren’t for Galbatorix. And it’s him and his magic that’s caused this whole mess.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Someone snorted. “True enough, but I’d bet every last copper I have that, Galbatorix or no, you still would’ve ended up with an arrow sticking out of you. You’re too mean to do anything other than fight.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Eragon saved my life in Feinster, you know,” said Svern.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye, and if you bore us with the story one more time, I’ll have you scrubbing pots for a week.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well, he did. …”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">There was another silence, which was broken when the deep-voiced warrior sighed. “We need a way to protect ourselves. That’s the problem. We’re at the mercy of the elves, the magicians—ours and theirs—and every other strange creature that roams the land. It’s all well and fine for the likes of Eragon, but we’re not so fortunate. What we need is—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What we need,” said Svern, “are the Riders. They’d put the world in order.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“<span class="italic">Pfft</span>. With what dragons? You can’t have Riders without dragons. Besides, we still wouldn’t be able to defend ourselves, and that’s what bothers me. I’m not a child to go hiding behind my mother’s skirts, but if a Shade were to appear out of the night, there isn’t a blasted thing we could do to keep it from tearing our heads off.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That reminds me, did you hear about Lord Barst?” asked the third man.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Svern uttered a sound of agreement. “I heard he ate his heart afterward.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“What’s this now?” asked the deep-voiced warrior.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Barst—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Barst?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“You know, the earl with an estate up by Gil’ead—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Isn’t he the one who drove his horses into the Ramr just to spite—”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Aye, that’s the one. Anyway, so he goes to this village and orders all the men to join Galbatorix’s army. Same story as always. Only, the men refuse, and they attack Barst and his soldiers.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Brave,” said the deep-voiced man. “Stupid, but brave.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Well, Barst was too clever for them; he had archers posted around the village before he went in. The soldiers kill half the men and thrash the rest within an inch of their lives. No surprise there. Then Barst takes the leader, the man who started the fight, and he grabs him by the neck, and with his bare hands, he pulls his head right off!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“No.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Like a chicken. And what’s worse, he ordered the man’s family burned alive as well.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Barst must be as strong as an Urgal to tear off a man’s head,” said Svern.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Maybe there’s a trick to it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Could it be magic?” asked the deep-voiced man.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“By all accounts, he’s always been strong—strong and smart. When he was just a young man, he’s said to have killed a wounded ox with a single blow of his fist.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“Still sounds like magic to me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">“That’s because you see evil magicians lurking in every shadow, you do.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The deep-voiced warrior grunted, but did not speak.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After that, the men dispersed to walk their rounds, and Eragon heard nothing more from them. At any other time, their conversation <span>might</span> have disturbed him, but because of his meditation, he remained unperturbed throughout, although he made an effort to remember what they said, so that he could consider it properly later.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Once his thoughts were in order, and he felt calm and relaxed, Eragon closed off his mind, opened his eyes, and slowly unfolded his legs, working the stiffness out of his muscles.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The motion of the candle flame caught his eye, and he stared at it for a minute, enthralled by the contortions of the fire.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then he went over to where he had dropped Saphira’s saddlebags earlier and removed the quill, the brush, the bottle of ink, and the sheets of parchment that he had begged off Jeod several days before, as well as the copy of <span class="italic">Domia abr Wyrda</span> that the old scholar had given him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Returning to the cot, Eragon placed the heavy book well away from him, so as to minimize the chances of spilling ink on it. He laid his shield across his knees, like a tray, and spread the sheets of parchment over the curved surface. A sharp, tannic odor filled his nostrils as he unstoppered the bottle and dipped the quill into the oak-gall ink.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He touched the nib of the feather against the lip of the bottle, to draw off the excess liquid, then carefully made his first stroke. The quill produced a faint scratching sound as he wrote out the runes of his native language. When he finished, he compared them to his efforts from the previous night, to see if his handwriting had improved—only a small amount—as well as to the runes in <span class="italic">Domia abr Wyrda</span>, which he was using as his guide.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He went through the alphabet three more times, paying special attention to the shapes that he had the most difficulty forming. Then he began to write down his thoughts and observations concerning the day’s events. The exercise was useful not only because it provided him with a convenient means of practicing his letters, but also because it helped him better understand everything he had seen and done over the course of the day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Laborious as it was, he enjoyed the writing, for he found the <span>challenges</span> it presented stimulating. Also, it reminded him of Brom, of how the old storyteller had taught him the meaning of each rune, which gave Eragon a sense of closeness with his father that otherwise eluded him.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">After he had said everything he wished to say, he washed the quill clean, then exchanged it for the brush and selected a sheet of parchment that was already half covered with rows of glyphs from the ancient language.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">The elves’ mode of writing, the Liduen Kvaedhí, was far harder to reproduce than the runes of his own race, owing to the glyphs’ intricate, flowing shapes. Nevertheless, he persisted for two reasons: He needed to maintain his familiarity with the script. And if he was going to write anything in the ancient language, he thought it wiser to do it in a form that most people were unable to understand.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Eragon had a good memory, but even so, he had found he was starting to forget many of the spells Brom and Oromis had taught him. Thus he had decided to compile a dictionary of every word he knew in the ancient language. Although it was hardly an original idea, he had not appreciated the value of such a compendium until very recently.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">He worked on the dictionary for another few hours, whereupon he returned his writing supplies to the saddlebags and took out the chest containing Glaedr’s heart of hearts. He tried to rouse the old dragon from his stupor, as he had so many times before, and as always, he failed. Eragon refused to give up, however. Sitting next to the open chest, he read aloud to Glaedr from <span class="italic">Domia abr Wyrda</span> about the dwarves’ many rites and rituals—few of which Eragon was familiar with—until it was the coldest, darkest part of the night.</span></p>
<p class="calibre25"><span class="calibre5">Then Eragon set aside the book, extinguished the candle, and lay down on the cot to rest. He wandered through the fantastic visions of his waking dreams for only a short while; once the first hint of light appeared in the east, he rolled upright to begin the whole cycle anew.</span></p>
